# lobbying_with_LLM
## Submitted Solution to [Google AI Hackathon](https://googleai.devpost.com/):
* Using Google's Gemini AI to assess senatorial stance on various policies, laws and ideas based on their public statements on X.com (Twitter.com)
* The interaction is made through a Streamlit Application wich results into:
  
  * A Table with all senators twitter handles separated into Support, Opposition, Neutral and Undecided with regard to the asked question by user.
  
  * A Pie Chart to visualize, in percentage points, the distribution of senators' positions.
