I’m proud that after my investigation into the high cost of inhalers, three of the biggest inhaler manufacturers have capped their inhaler prices at $35/month! https://t.co/urIr8awp0CWisconsin’s veterans, service members, and military families sacrifice so much to keep our country safe. I was proud to honor their service and ensure they have the benefits and support they deserve. ⬇️ https://t.co/orF7kiibQhI was proud to secure resources for the Wisconsin dairy industry to help our processors and farmers innovate their products, reach new markets, and grow our economy. It was great to be with @WICDR today to see their work in action! https://t.co/6OcGRUEi5vWith our PACT Act, we’re keeping our promise to our nation’s veterans. Last month, we made it even easier for toxic-exposed veterans to get the health care they earned. Thousands of Wisconsin veterans have filed their PACT Act claims. File yours today! ⬇️To get ahead of the fentanyl crisis, we must provide the tools and training necessary to keep our first responders safe on the job so that they can keep all of us safe. I’m working to do just that. https://t.co/hdWsQm0I1bSarah should still be with us today. I’m working to pass my bill to honor her legacy, prevent future tragedies, and give our communities the resources to build safer walking and biking infrastructure. https://t.co/UcZs5KH60RToday, and every day, I stand with the trans community in celebrating the courage and dignity of living life as who you are.
