0,SenTinaSmith,"The Comstock Act is a tool Republicans want to weaponize to ban mailing medication abortion for the entire country, even in states like Minnesota.
 
@AGEllison and I want to take that tool away from them. https://t.co/jKFgetHh60Over 300,000 jobs added in March, marking 39 consecutive months of job growth. Wages grew by 4.1%, outpacing inflation.
 
We still have work to do, but we're investing in the American people - and it's paying off.We all deserve to age with dignity. It was an honor to meet with @trellisconnects, @DARTS_MN and Minnesotans who benefit from the Older Americans Act to discuss how to ensure older Americans have the resources they need to maintain their health and independence as they age. https://t.co/DOeKP3UDX5Retirees earned their pensions and retirement savings through a lifetime of hard work, and they deserve to know their retirement is secure.

This updated rule will bring much-needed accountability to large financial institutions that engage in criminal misconduct.Martin Luther King Jr. was killed in an act of hate 56 years ago.

His legacy will live on forever, and we will never stop fighting as a nation to achieve his dream - equality for all Americans, regardless of race.It doesn’t take a mathematician to understand Medicare reimbursement for EMS doesn’t add up. 

That’s why @SenSanders, @SenPeterWelch and I are pushing for a legislative fix — the EMS ROCS Act 🚑🚨This Public Health Week, I want to thank all of the health care professionals around the country who work to keep our communities safe.

Public health emergencies affect everyone, and we are a stronger nation when we support a workforce that keeps Americans happy and healthy.Very few Republicans will publicly admit they want a total abortion ban in every state, but if they try to misuse the Comstock Act (an anti-vice law from 1873) to stop people from accessing medication abortion, that’s what they’ll achieve.

I’m prepared to fight back…Trans rights are human rights. 
 
On Trans Visibility Day, I’m committed to taking Minnesota’s values to the federal level.
 
That means passing a Trans Bill of Rights and the Equality Act 🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍🌈Happy Easter, Minnesota! Wishing you all a joyful day with your loved ones 💐🐰Minnesota represent! Mavs all the way!If you don’t support birth control, don’t use it.One of our most deeply-held values as Minnesotans is we help neighbors in need. When I-35W collapsed, Congress swiftly passed legislation to help rebuild it.
 
Count me in.North 6th Avenue was one of Minneapolis' most up-and-coming, diverse communities — then a highway was built through the middle of it, gutting it and decimating its economic future.

We secured funding to take the first step to right that wrong. https://t.co/Gft4iaBGo6This bridge collapse brings back tough memories for Minnesotans. One of the hardest days of all my time in public service was when the I-35W bridge collapsed into the Mississippi River.

My thoughts are with Baltimore and the loved ones of anyone still missing.The Affordable Care Act was signed into law 14 years ago. Over 21 million people enrolled in health coverage last year - the highest enrollment rate in its history.
 
We need to move forward, not backwards. Republicans continue to vow to repeal it, but I won't let that happen.This was an inexcusable tragedy. 7 aid workers – the very best of humanity – killed by an Israeli attack.

People who were willing to put their lives on the line to feed starving people in Gaza and all over the world.

Israel needs to stop killing civilians and aid workers.Netanyahu saying, “I’m sorry this happened but that’s the way it goes in war,” isn’t enough.

@WCKitchen does this across the world, coordinated with the IDF and clearly marked their vehicles, and were still attacked.Republicans want to revive an arcane law from the 1800s to circumvent laws in states like Minnesota, whose voters protected abortion rights at the ballot box.
 
I've been reaching out to my colleagues in Congress to build support around legislation to repeal the Comstock Act.Read more about the Comstock Act and how I plan to fight back ⬇️

https://t.co/kZWNXQggAUIt’s simple: people shouldn’t have to choose between buying groceries, heating their home or paying for a medication they need to breathe.On Native HIV Awareness Day, I am grateful to Minnesota’s Indigenous Peoples Task Force for connecting folks to housing and testing. Their new building, Mik-wane-dun Aud-i-soo-kon, or ""remember our teachings,"" will make their services even more accessible to those in need. https://t.co/0UoHHkgotoPeggy Flanagan does incredible work for the state of Minnesota and is paving the way for Native women in elected positions everywhere.

Congratulations on this honor, @LtGovFlanagan ! https://t.co/mnnjFVzUsQNew Abortion Data from @Guttmacher:
--
Over 1M abortions were performed in the United States last year (a 10% increase since 2020). 63% were via medication abortion.

Take a guess which method is Republicans’ next target in their crusade against reproductive health care…? https://t.co/60lbzFk3pCAgriculture is the backbone of our economy. 

On National Agriculture Day, I am thankful for the farmers and ranchers across the country who work tirelessly every day 🚜Leonard Peltier should not be in prison - even the U.S. Attorney who put him there agrees.

He deserves compassionate release to spend the rest of his life with his family and community.Credit where credit is due, this line comes from great sociologist Jess Calarco (@JessicaCalarco) and I heartily agree!From touring their 'hempcrete' homes to exploring their business incubator supporting Dakota entrepreneurs, my visit to Lower Sioux today was great.
 
I'm thankful for their commitment to sustainability, cultural preservation, and community empowerment. https://t.co/MmbDD9F1jpVisited @MNSUMankato to hear about their work to drive progress in rural Minnesota.

From supporting food and ag businesses with the help of federal funding to training mental health professionals to care for rural communities, MNSU is making a lasting impact on the region. https://t.co/Gbq0NaPGZgLong COVID has uprooted thousands of lives. We don’t have answers yet, but we can’t give up.

This Long COVID Awareness Day, I’m thinking of #LongHaulers still suffering – we hear you, we see you.Nex Benedict has been on everyone’s minds lately. Nex should still be with us today.
 
We have a lot of work to do for LGBTQ+ youth mental health. Grateful to introduce this legislation alongside @SenLaphonza 🏳️‍🌈President Biden's budget proposal would:
 
Reduce the deficit by $3 trillion.
Create a first-time homebuyer tax credit.
Invest in affordable child care.
Strengthen social security.
 
The list goes on. President Biden is fighting to improve the lives of the American people.Vice President Harris knows that Republicans want a national abortion ban.

I’m glad she’s on the road to talk about defending reproductive freedom and organizing to restore the rights that have been ripped away.

Welcome to Minnesota.Netanyahu’s policies compromise the long term security of Israelis and Americans, and he continues to thwart the delivery of humanitarian aid to Palestinian citizens in Gaza. 

I’m with Leader Schumer: new elections in Israel for new leadership.Housing is an incredibly complex, nuanced area with tons of historical context, but if I had to boil it down, I’d say this…

𝑯𝒖𝒈𝒆 𝑫𝒆𝒎𝒂𝒏𝒅 + 𝑳𝒐𝒘 𝑺𝒖𝒑𝒑𝒍𝒚 = 𝑯𝒊𝒈𝒉 𝑷𝒓𝒊𝒄𝒆𝒔

How do we fix it? President Biden said it best: build, build, build 🏗️🏢🏡Breonna Taylor was unfairly taken from us four years ago today.

Everyone deserves to feel safe in their communities. And Breonna deserves justice. https://t.co/6RAEDOO31TCivil rights leaders led by Martin Luther King Jr. marched from Selma to Montgomery in the name of equality 59 years ago.

They walked 12 miles a day in the cold.
They slept in fields.
They faced fierce opposition.

But they persevered. https://t.co/9LKPBJe9vBThe Civil Rights March fueled a revolution that continues to this day.

Today I’m thinking about civil rights leaders like John Lewis, Roy Wilkins and the thousands of unsung heroes who fight for equal rights and equity every single day. https://t.co/XFUCJKvGF1Many families say it’s cheaper for a parent to not work than to find childcare in their area.

But innovation in childcare is helping fill that need. New Ulm is using local and federal funds to create a pod-style model that can help dozens of families access affordable childcare. https://t.co/YD2ru36iMlThis innovative operation helps childcare providers by securing an affordable location - which means more providers can start new businesses and stay in business.
 
That means parents can go to work, kids have a safe place to learn and play, and local economies can thrive.Wow… if you want to see the sexism that permeates this platform since Musk took it over, take a gander at the replies to this 🤦Thousands of janitors in Minnesota will see $20 an hour, more sick time and lower health care costs.

Organizing works. Congrats on the win!Women have to work fourteen and half months to earn as much as men do in a year. It's 2024. I'm tired of having to highlight #EqualPayDay.

It's not that complicated: equal pay for equal work.Without a safe, affordable place to live nothing else in your life works – Secretary Fudge understands that. She worked hard to tackle homelessness and boost affordable housing.
 
Thank you for your decades of public service and enjoy your retirement @SecFudge! https://t.co/eAk9FR7pqtRamadan Mubarak, Minnesota! Wishing those celebrating all across the state a blessed and joyful Ramadan.President Biden is prioritizing the middle class.
 
Wages are up.
Employment is up.
Prescription drug costs are down.
 
This is what it looks like to invest in the American people.RT @SenStabenow: More proof Joe Biden’s policies are working for the American people!RT @POTUS: Joining me at my State of the Union is Keenan, a public school educator from Minnesota.

He's prepared hundreds of students for…We passed the biggest climate bill in the world — and boosting the economy while we do it.

We won’t go back.
Our future depends on it.Was it the public school teacher raise?
Cutting the price of prescription drugs? 
Protecting democracy abroad?Whether you rent or own…

Without a safe, stable, affordable place to live, nothing else in your life works.

President Biden gets that.The economy is stronger when we build it from the bottom up and the middle out, not the top down.
 
President Biden gets that. He oversaw one of the greatest economic recoveries ever, making up for ALL the jobs lost to COVID—and then adding 400,000 more EACH MONTH on top of that. https://t.co/XZ169e4KQLI worked at Planned Parenthood. I’ve seen firsthand how women can make their own decisions about their own health care, including abortion.

President Biden gets that. He wants politicians out of your health care decisions.I was here on January 6th and will never forget what I felt. American democracy was on the brink of collapse.
 
President Biden’s remarks tonight bring me optimism. They bring me hope that we can steer America in the right direction.The Netanyahu government’s interference with humanitarian operations in Gaza violates American law.

The Biden Administration needs to make it clear to Netanyahu that failure to immediately change course will have serious consequences, including withholding military aid.The law is clear. Given the urgency of the crisis in Gaza and the repeated refusal to address American concerns on this issue, immediate action is necessary.

The Biden Administration should use this authority to secure an immediate change in policy from the Netanyahu government.Delayed mail. Canceled deliveries. Faulty reporting.

The most recent report from the Inspector General confirms what I’ve been hearing from constituents - there are serious issues with postal operations in Minnesota. https://t.co/qHPieZkhTtUSPS can’t even acknowledge there’s a problem because they rely on faulty data. I introduced the Postal Delivery Accountability Act to make their data more reliable.
 
Let’s get it done.On this International Women’s Day, we honor and celebrate the incredible women who have paved the way for new generations of leaders. Today, I want to honor my friend and Chair of the Bois Forte Band of Chippewa, Cathy Chavers. https://t.co/B61V1erQAJChair Chavers has worked tirelessly to protect and strengthen Tribal sovereignty, including by successfully restoring 28,000 acres of land to her Tribe. She is deeply committed to serving her community and paving the way for other Indigenous women to lead.Keenan! Warms my heart to see Minnesotans benefitting from Public Service Loan Forgiveness.
 
Teachers are some of the most powerful influences on young people, so thank you for all that you do, enjoy your time in DC and tell Dr. Biden hello!Welcome Sweden! This is a major step for our national security.

Just a few years ago, if you told anyone Sweden was joining NATO, they would’ve brushed you off.
 
A strong NATO means a strong firewall against Russia 🇸🇪🇺🇸RT @SenateDems: WATCH: @SenTinaSmith lays out how Democrats’ Inflation Reduction Act is lowering healthcare costs for Americans. https://t.…I’ve gotta respect how Senator Sinema did the job of United States Senator on her own terms — even if we didn’t always agree.

She has been a force.Credit card companies make over $14 billion every year in late fees, punishing people who struggle to make ends meet.

It’s the definition of kicking someone while they’re down, and a perfect example of why it’s so expensive to be poor in America.

Good move by President Biden.I’m with the Vice President. Immediate ceasefire for at least six weeks to find a path forward. 

Glad to see she’s meeting with Benny Gantz to help find that path.Today marks the anniversary of Bloody Sunday, a pivotal moment in our nation’s civil rights history.
 
@VP Harris visited Selma on Sunday for the memorial to honor the peaceful demonstrators who were brutally attacked on the Edmund Pettus Bridge. https://t.co/Sj8MlFUOTwWhen the marchers came to the Edmund Pettus Bridge, they were met by a line of state and county officers, who chased protestors down on horseback, including women and children, and beat them with weapons.
 
Many were hospitalized with severe injuries. https://t.co/yVq6hAZsXiWe just reintroduced the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and need to pass it to protect the erosion of voting rights we’re seeing in state legislatures across the country. https://t.co/02qlkE7BggShe’s known as the woman protecting access to abortion despite the best efforts of North Dakota Republicans. Now she’s my guest at the State of the Union.

Her name is Tammi Kromenaker, and she’s one badass woman. https://t.co/BEU3P3kGhQI visited Red River Women’s Clinic last year to hear about their operation and how the fall of Roe has impacted them. They’ve seen patients from across the country coming to Minnesota for help.
 
We’re Minnesota nice. We’re happy to help others. https://t.co/xuv0km9KPKTammi represents the coalition of advocates, organizers and providers serving as our last line of defense for what little access we have left since Trump and Republican’s Supreme Court stole our rights.
 
It’s also the coalition who will get those rights back. https://t.co/ihwqIRrLLeWhen Republicans’ Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, Tammi knew the writing was on the wall: North Dakota would ban abortion, and Minnesota would be an island of abortion care in the Upper Midwest.
 
She moved her entire clinic across the river from Fargo, ND to Moorhead, MN. https://t.co/zLvN0nj9YlShe knew the laws of North Dakota inside and out – but after moving her clinic just ten minutes away, she had to learn an entirely new set of rules just so women could access health care. https://t.co/Xryw33hJYKVeterans made enormous sacrifices for this country and deserve to be recognized for it.
 
This Women's History Month, I want to highlight the accomplishments of one veteran in particular: Shelby Setnikar. https://t.co/STXiezUy1SShe spent seven months overseas fighting for this country's freedom. When she came home, she wanted to give back to the community that changed her life.
 
She enrolled in college and became a pharmacist, working at the Minneapolis VA helping veterans every single day.In 2023, she was honored at the White House for being a trailblazing female veteran. 

Her courage to serve this country and resulting contributions to her community exemplify the bravery and dedication of our female veterans.Solidarity with the 8,000 janitors and security workers on strike in Minnesota.
 
Fair contracts for essential workers ✊The first ever over-the-counter birth control is launching today!

Anyone who wants birth control should have access to it regardless of their insurance status. We’re one step closer to making that a reality.I met a Minnesota couple this morning who shared with me that their children were conceived through IVF. 

IVF has brought joy to so many people trying to start or expand their families. Everyone, no matter where they live, should have the right to seek it out if they want to. https://t.co/ZfYncPuQEl1) Alabama jeopardizes IVF.
2) Republicans issue statements.
3) Dems try passing a bill protecting IVF.
4) Republicans block it.

Empty promises. If I were a betting woman, I’d say they’ll do the exact same thing when it comes to contraception.Marcus Carpenter spoke on The Jennifer Hudson Show and I couldn’t agree more with his message – empowering farmers of color is vital to the future of agriculture. Marcus is championing the needs of rural communities and expanding opportunities in farming for everyone. https://t.co/4QjJnEYHVJRepublicans have actively blocked legislation protecting IVF.

Actions speak louder than words, and no messaging guidance is going to get them out of taking responsibility for what’s happening in Alabama. https://t.co/lpc0fyGbu8The University of Minnesota system has touched the lives of millions of Minnesotans, from supporting students pursuing higher education to fostering world-class medical care and groundbreaking academic research.

Dr. Cunningham will make an excellent addition to the university 〽️Veterans deserve the best possible care, especially when they’re victims of sexual assault. I’m joining @SenatorTester in urging the VA to step up staff training so veterans get the care they deserve at all VA facilities.

Veterans served our country. We need to show up for them. https://t.co/a4WT3xUfZnSweden will join NATO, strengthening our alliance and expanding the firewall defending Europe from Putin.Ahmaud Arbery was jogging down the street when he was killed in an act of hate — for no other reason than his race.
 
On the 4th anniversary of his death, I am committed to working towards a more just and equitable future for Black Americans.Anyone who wants birth control should be able to get it without worrying about endless insurance hassles. It's required under the Affordable Care Act, but insurance companies are still trying to skirt the law.

Insurers: You are required to cover birth control. Do your job.My heart breaks for the Alabama women who went through the rigorous and expensive process of IVF, the moms whose hopes and dreams to become pregnant were unjustly ripped away without warning.

Reproductive freedom means so much more than just the right to abortion care.A 16-year-old in Florida was denied an abortion and forced to have a child.
 
A woman in Virginia was denied medication to treat lupus because it can *sometimes* be used to end early pregnancies.
 
This is the post-Roe chaos Republicans and their Supreme Court created.Women are fully capable of making their own reproductive health care decisions.
 
Without politicians.
Without judges.
Without shame.Julie Su is dedicated to the needs of the American economy and its workers – just read her backstory about garment workers in California. https://t.co/79uZrNWh4H72 Thai immigrants – who were mostly women – were enslaved in a sweatshop and forced to work up to 18 hours a day with horrible working conditions and little to no pay.

Su secured legal immigration status and $4 million in stolen wages for these workers.She has the determination and passion to be a true champion of workers and businesses alike.

I’m pleased to support her nomination for Secretary of Labor. https://t.co/Cmu3h1ycD3Actions speak louder than words. May I remind everyone that we actually tried to pass a bill protecting IVF just over a year ago?
 
Republicans blocked it.Here are the receipts 🧾⬇️ 

https://t.co/zzoHEr42acI’ve heard countless stories of Minnesotans who have been working for a decade or more to pay off their student loans, but still have a balance, even though they’ve made monthly payments.
 
Now, they’re finally getting relief.Millions of families have felt bogged down and left behind for doing what their parents told them: pursuing higher education.
 
The Supreme Court kept the President from delivering broader relief, but that’s not stopping him from easing the burden of student debt however he can.I’ve heard countless stories of Minnesotans who have been working for a decade or more to pay off their student loans, but still have a balance, even though they’ve made monthly payments.
 
Now, they’re finally getting relief.Minnesota hosted the Nordic Skiing World Cup this weekend, and Jessie Diggins competed at home — for the first time in over a decade.
 
Congratulations @jessdiggs on making the podium — Minnesota is proud of you ⛷️🥉Reproductive freedom is about more than just the right to have an abortion — it's the right to make your own decisions about your reproductive health.
 
This decision in Alabama is shameful and criminalizes women for making their own decisions about pregnancy.Speaker Johnson should hold a vote on Ukraine aid – it would easily pass on a bipartisan basis. Blocking it plays into Putin's hands.

Alexei Navalny was Putin’s lead critic and was unjustly silenced. My heart is with his family.

We can’t let Russia’s brutality to go unchecked.Abdinoor’s story of losing his home is just one of hundreds. Too many Minnesotans are finding themselves trapped in predatory land contracts.

This is why we wrote the Preserving Pathways to Homeownership Act — to protect people like Abdinoor.BREAKING: @MSPAirport's Terminal 2 is getting two brand new gates! ✈️👷

President Biden's infrastructure law is making it easier for everyone to explore all that Minnesota has to offer,  including some snow (finally).Finally. Winter comes to Minnesota. https://t.co/hp7tWNQdFs6 years since Parkland experienced an unthinkable tragedy. 17 lives – friends, brothers, sisters, sons and daughters – were taken from us. Countless others are living with the trauma of that day.

This is great news for Eli Lilly users - now let's expand this cap to all insulin manufacturers, and permanently.This isn’t a tax hike.
This wasn’t a new tax.

This is because Democrats said we should go after rich, powerful corporations and people who spend millions of dollars rigging the system in their favor.James Fairbanks was the first Native American to serve as a Force Master Chief in our military. He grew up on the White Earth Reservation and enlisted in the Marines after high school.

He was honorably discharged in 1972 – but later decided he wasn’t finished with his service. https://t.co/Xx2HsU8ltfHe enlisted in the Navy a few years later, receiving a Bronze Star for his service in Iraq and ascending through the ranks to become the first Native person to lead sailors as a Force Master Chief. 

Today, the Navy named a Navajo-class rescue and salvage ship in James’ honor. https://t.co/RCpsuk2FcwAlexei Navalny is dead. Evan Gershkovich is still wrongfully detained in Russia. Putin is a dictator and a war criminal, not a friend.Speaker Johnson’s opposition to aiding Ukraine emboldens Putin’s cruelty and puts our national security at risk.This is tragic news, that two police officers and a firefighter have been shot and lost their lives doing their jobs. 

Every day police and firefighters leave their own families to go to work to protect all of us.Sending solidarity to Burnsville and heartfelt condolences to the families of those who lost their loved ones.

https://t.co/pQSXWbjKSDFarmers constantly share with me stories about ‘Farm Stress’ and how we need to be doing more to support mental health of Farmers and Ranchers, whose hard (and often thankless) work keeps our economy moving.
 
So mental health care should be accessible no matter where you live.The Farmers First Act will revitalize stress assistance programs aimed at supporting farmers and producers. Farmers lie at the bedrock of our country and we need to support them."

Allow illegal immigrants who commit crimes, like the man who killed Laken Riley, to be released back onto our streets…Every single Senate Democrat voted to continue @JoeBiden’s southern border crisis and the American people are watching. 

They are showing their true colors.For the second time in a month, Washington is failing Montanans and the American people by passing yet another out-of-control spending bill that does nothing to restore much-needed sanity to our budget process.With wasteful earmarks for pet projects as far as the eye can see, it is long past time that members of Congress feel the pain of their own fiscal mismanagement.I could not support yet another abuse of taxpayer funds and will continue to advocate that if Congress does not pass its budget on time, members should not get paid.Cats are up!!

GO CATS!!Senator Schumer's speech today complaining about foreign interference in American elections while calling for new elections in Israel, especially while it is in the middle of an existential war, is hypocritical and a dangerous new low in American foreign policy.Israel’s government is 15 months into a four-year term and the war it is waging is Israel’s fight, not just Prime Minister Netanyahu’s. The call for new elections today is a cynical ploy to placate the American Left as our own election is just months away.President Biden should immediately disavow Senator Schumer’s progressive pandering.

https://t.co/aLgH9Jz2qnIt’s the same everywhere I go – Alaskans are worried about affordable housing and childcare. 

https://t.co/4EXgRD65HWI was able to direct $5.6 million for the @UA_System to build a childcare facility in Fairbanks, $2.5 million for the North Pole to support infrastructure for affordable housing, and $1 million for the Fairbanks Neighborhood Housing Services to rehabilitate rental units.These investments will make it more affordable for Alaskans to raise a family in the Interior.The effects of the housing shortage have been seen across the state, but nowhere are the impacts felt more acutely than in Sitka.Securing over $2 million for the Sitka Community Development Corporation to build a new apartment complex will offer new home ownership opportunities for first time buyers, with the Trust’s model of ownership preserving that affordability permanently.Thanks to the partnership of the city and the borough, we are looking at a new neighborhood of fourteen homes plus apartment units. 

https://t.co/HKXiJrE3csI worked hard to ensure these bills will strengthen our  military capabilities including delivering an icebreaker to Alaska waters, improve Alaskans’ access to healthcare, bolster workforce development, support our families, and improve border security.

Started yesterday morning with March Madness consolation game at 8am watching my nephew play his last game as a senior and ended the day at the 1A boys championship game with an exciting win by King Cove and then the 2A girls matchup between Metlakatla and Tikigaq. Great high school basketball!!

The afternoon was spent with hundreds of young people from around the Arctic as we closed out the Arctic Winter Games. So proud of the young athletes and the many Alaskan volunteers who made the event possible. Great job MatSu!As illegal drugs devastate families and communities throughout Alaska, I continue to fight for drug prevention efforts and support for those impacted. https://t.co/ncBFA5X81wIt was an honor to present medals to the U-16 women’s winners at the 2024 Arctic Winter Games! This year’s games are being held in the Mat-Su Valley with roughly 2,000 athletes from around the Arctic. https://t.co/zMUocIjeBDFor the first time in Iditarod history, 4 women mushers finished in the top 10.  It was an amazing showing by Paige Drobny, Mille Porsild, Amanda Otto, &amp; Jessie Royer, whose grit &amp; perseverance led them to strong races over the 1,000-mile journey.
https://t.co/2DxVscKNBNI spoke on the Senate floor this week to celebrate an historical occasion in a 51-year-old Alaskan tradition. On Tuesday evening, Dallas Seavey crossed the finish line in Nome, winning the 2024 Iditarod championship for a record-setting 6th time.

As the rest of the teams finish their races, I want to congratulate and commend everyone who takes part in this incredible tradition, from the mushers and dogs to the support staff, volunteers, and sponsors that make this incredible event possible. Nothing better captures the grit, ruggedness, perseverance, spirit, or sheer audacity of Alaskans.

https://t.co/XADc1JB0J2Alaska’s oceans and fisheries are the heartbeat of communities across the state—& that’s why I worked hard to include provisions throughout the appropriations package that will strengthen our blue economy, support coastal communities, promote electronic monitoring development and installation, and enhance research abilities to create healthier fisheries.In the appropriations package, I provided support for tidal energy projects, secured funding for critical mineral activities, and provided for the Arctic Energy Office to support projects in rural communities and throughout the Arctic. https://t.co/cVY2qOTkILWATCH: Dallas Seavey crosses the Iditarod finish in Nome line to win his record breaking 6th race.

Public service is a commitment to making a difference in the community and people around you—& being engaged with leadership & community are things that both Elizabeth & Felix are passionate about. I look forward to seeing what these future leaders continue to accomplish for our country!In the appropriations package that just passed the Senate, I included significant funding for infrastructure projects that will help build out and modernize roads, bridges, ports, and airport projects across Alaska. https://t.co/FJ2xY1VCzu“Instead of consulting with Alaska Natives on the North Slope, BLM violated its own policies and deliberately excluded them from informing the development of this rule. Hastily arranged public meetings after the policy was set—including one where administration officials claimed they couldn’t extend the comment period, because they were trying to avoid the Congressional Review Act—have cemented our view that this is a fait accompli, not a true public process.”

Thanks to researchers such as Dr. Nikoosh Carlo & Dr. Jessica Black for sharing their transformative efforts.Today, I had a constructive meeting with General Daniel Hokanson, Chief of the National Guard Bureau, regarding the proposed cuts to our Active-Duty Guard forces in Alaska. I emphasized the critical role these guardsmen play for national security, how this cut pulls the rug out from under these Airmen, and the detrimental impact it is having on them and their families.

When I met with the Airmen whose jobs were on the cutting block, I made a pledge I would fight for them - I won’t back down from that commitment.As we navigate new technology, like AI, we should have confidence that what we are hearing and seeing—especially when it comes to our elections—is factual, and real. My bill with @SenAmyKlobuchar only requires a disclaimer when political ads use AI in a significant way – something I think we can all agree we’d like to know. https://t.co/xuQD4jqeJ5Great to meet with advocates from the @FoodBankofAK  to discuss their great efforts to ensure Alaskans have enough food each day.

We met in the Capitol today to discuss the National Guard Bureau’s proposed cuts to our Active Duty Guard forces in Alaska. We are working together on a solution. https://t.co/PLDWWorF1uLast week, I met with Alaska Air Guardsmen who gave me their patches to reinforce that they gave a commitment to our country and state – and are personally feeling the impact of these proposed cuts.I promised I would stand up to ensure our homeland defense mission remains steadfast – and that we will treat them with the dignity and respect they are owed for that commitment.This announcement will come as a relief to countless Alaskans. From the potential for even higher grocery prices to longer-term store closures, there were just too many unknowns and uncertainties for this merger to move forward. 

https://t.co/sCYbUiZvFlThe delegation worked hard to ensure that Alaskans’ concerns were understood, with @Rep_Peltola leading the effort. Her direct advocacy with the FTC and her town halls across the state ensured that Alaskans’ voices were heard in Washington, DC.I had an incredibly humbling meeting this morning with dedicated Air National Guard members impacted by the nearly 100 cuts to Active Guard positions in Alaska proposed by the National Guard Bureau. https://t.co/lV5Roa0xK2I am working with my colleagues on the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee and NGB leadership to find the resources to immediately stop these cuts - the potential impact to our Homeland Defense Mission in the Arctic is grave.The impact to these airmen and their families is even worse."

https://t.co/GsGcWYW2ANThese numbers aren’t a coincidence. 

The Biden open border agenda is an invitation to our adversaries and a threat to our national security.I’m praying for our great friend Taiwan as they begin to recover from this week’s devastating earthquake. May God place His healing hands on the Taiwanese people.The United States should be restricting Iran’s access to currency abroad. Instead, the Biden administration is expanding it.
 
That's unacceptable, &amp; I'm leading my colleagues in calling for answers: https://t.co/jxpI0JsJfJRT @BankingGOP: NEW: Following the Biden admin’s decision to grant another Iran sanctions waiver, @SenatorTimScott is leading his colleague…President Biden’s decision to leave our southern border wide open risks emboldening our adversaries. 

Make no mistake, border security is national security.
https://t.co/3pyzqc9HXEWell deserved @dawnstaley! A true leader and a fantastic ambassador for our state. Bring home the 🏆 this weekend!Gas prices are up nearly 14% this year.

@ClemsonMBBAnother failure in leadership from President Biden. 

The United States needs to be standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Israel. This is a weak response that only serves to undermine our ally in the face of terror.$4.9 trillion.

That’s the tax increase President Biden wants to hammer Americans with over the next decade to pay for his socialist agenda.The @FCC’s “digital discrimination” rule is another effort by the administration to control nearly every aspect of the Internet.

I am standing firm against this rule because it undermines basic American freedoms and creates crippling liability for the broadband industry.The U.S. is built on freedom and opportunity, giving everyone the chance to work hard to achieve the American Dream. Legacy admissions undermine these uniquely American principles.

I'm proud to champion the MERIT Act with @SenToddYoung so all students stand on equal footing.Biden’s 4th Circuit nominee, Nicole Berner, described the right-to-work movement as “deeply racist” and pushed for illegal immigrants to have the same labor rights as U.S. citizens. These radical views and contempt for the rule of law make her unfit to serve on the federal bench.Opportunity Zones have transformed communities in South Carolina – and across the country.
 
When it comes to housing, they’ve incentivized the construction of affordable homes.
 
It's what happens when Washington works with local leaders to let the free market thrive. https://t.co/2RM3oYudsKInflation continues to drag down Americans’ ability to put food on the table, buy a home, and achieve their American Dream. 

The White House can’t spin the economic pain their policies are causing. https://t.co/9g4F8L2A5KAll the so-called American Rescue Plan did was drown us in debt, give away our tax dollars, create historic inflation, and exhaust the middle class.

What Americans want is the ability to control their own futures—not a socialist pipe dream.Laken Riley’s murder—by an illegal immigrant who was twice arrested and twice released onto our streets—is the result of an absolute failure by the Biden administration.
https://t.co/BZxgWJ9RoKThe solution is simple: secure our border and quit letting in criminals and murderers.

If our commander-in-chief can’t get that done, the American people deserve someone who will.A dangerous gang of killers straight from Venezuela’s prisons is slipping across President Biden’s open border.
https://t.co/h7zJyVKqv7I’m joining @SenMarcoRubio and @RepMariaSalazar in calling on the White House to take immediate action to address this threat and secure our border.

https://t.co/DRDk6juMdHSenator Schumer’s speech was ridiculous, dangerous, and undermines the leadership of our strongest ally in the region.Laken Riley was murdered by an illegal immigrant who was arrested and released, not once but twice onto our streets. 

This is a stark reminder of why President Biden's open border policy is a danger to Americans.
https://t.co/BZxgWJ9RoKI am doing everything in my power to end his senseless and deadly policies.Laken Riley was murdered by an illegal immigrant who was arrested and released, not once but twice onto our streets.

https://t.co/BZxgWJ9RoKUnder Biden’s economy, more Americans have been forced to put their purchases on their credit cards, and it’s getting harder to pay them off. 

It’s time to regain control of our economic policies.Our nation's social fabric is being torn apart by the abandonment of common sense on the Left.

Efforts to obscure, manipulate, or even silence this truth won't change the fact: illegal immigration is widely acknowledged as wrong by the American people.It’s always a pleasure to meet y’all for #PalmettoWednesdays! https://t.co/3C7jnUfv8uPrime Minister Netanyahu is right. When it comes to protecting innocent civilians from Hamas, there is no substitute for victory. https://t.co/9mdUzA6CW9American families can’t afford to wait for us to fix failing federal housing policy.
 
If we want to uplift all Americans, we have to consider new and meaningful approaches to federal housing programs so more families can achieve the dream of homeownership. https://t.co/JN7Her4r27Hamas is a ruthless, evil terrorist organization. They started this war, and they could end it now if they chose to. 

My heart goes out to the Chen family as they grieve this devastating loss.

https://t.co/NTuaxuLoUePresident Biden’s budget proposal would raise taxes across income levels and on job creators, hold back medical innovation, and give China a leg up.

1/ You need to know about this - it’s bad enough that I will vote against the entire bill.5/ The gun safety movement wins more than we lose now. The 2022 gun bill, which led to a historic 12% on year reduction in urban violence, is proof of our strength. More wins are ahead.

But this setback is evidence that we must stay vigilant. Maybe we let our guard down here.6/ I’m voting no because I do not accept a return to a time when the gun lobby could bury gun riders in appropriations bills (which happened frequently before Sandy Hook). 

This cannot happen again. And it won’t. If we keep organizing and growing.6/ And she did it. Quietly, she worked out a new compromise, she and I got domestic violence advocates on board, and she then just refused to take no for an answer from our Republican partners. 

Implausibly the final bill included a provision closing almost all of the loophole.7/ Listen, Kyrsten is way more conservative than me. We disagree on lots. You can think what you want of her. 

But this story isn't an outlier. Time after time, big important progressive things have happened bc behind the scenes Krysten wills them to happen. 

That's the truth.4/ Kyrsten's first job out of college was as a domestic violence shelter worker. She knew these women's stories. She knew the fatal cost of leaving the loophole in place.

At the meeting, we made no new progress. I started to suggest moving on. And then I caught Kyrsten's eyes.5/ I could read her eyes. ""DON'T DO IT, CHRIS"". And so I stopped mid thought. I dropped it.

After the meeting wrapped, she said to me, ""I know we're almost out of time. Just give me 48 more hours. I know I can get this done. I NEED to get this done.""There are LOTS of strong feelings about Sen. Sinema on this platform &amp; I'm not going to change anyone's mind. But bc she rarely talks to the press, few people know what she does behind the scenes.

1/ I didn't get anyone's permission to tell this story, but I'm doing it anyway.3/ Republicans stubbornly resisted every attempt we made to close the loophole. I was worried the clock was ticking and we'd lose our shot to get any gun bill. Three weeks into our talks, I told Kyrsten that if we couldn't get agreement at the next meeting, we had to move on.2/ Krysten and I were 2 of the 4 negotiators on the 2022 gun bill. Her priority was ending the ""boyfriend loophole"" which allowed domestic abusers to keep their guns if they weren't married to the victim. The loophole was a death sentence for thousands of women.

So they don’t want it measured.Insurers aren’t just looking at their own claims exposure, they’re looking at their exposure to an underfunded state plan’s claims, which they have to backstop.

Moving that risk to state plans is only a stopgap.At some point, with too little revenue covering too much risk, the market collapses, and the collapse can happen very fast. At the heart of this is the fossil fuel industry’s successful blockade of good climate policies, using the Republican Party as its tool.And in Texas, “home insurance rates rose 16% from May 2021 to May 2022 and 27% from May 2022 to May 2023,” and “the state-backed insurer of last resort [is] putting all Texans on the hook if a major storm strikes.”

https://t.co/8TAFrxJUYQThe FBI and the CIA have consistently raised serious concerns about the threat TikTok poses to national security and to the American people. Under the control of the Chinese Communist Party, TikTok has the ability to spy on, influence and harm the mental health of hundreds of millions of Americans.

Can you imagine Xi Jinping allowing an app with direct ties to the U.S. government being allowed to send messages that manipulate hundreds of millions of Chinese citizens and sow division in China? Of course not. Neither should the United States. 

TikTok is another serious example of the national security threat to America posed by the CCP and the non-reciprocal relationship that exists between our two countries across almost every imaginable sector. There is strong, bipartisan recognition of this threat, which sends a strong message to Xi and the dictators in Beijing. 

I’m reviewing the legislation that overwhelmingly passed the House, but I am strongly inclined to support legislative action. Senator Schumer should bring this bill to the Senate floor.This is the pattern for two years: Ukraine’s leaders ask for weapons; Biden delays; Congress pressures Biden, who reluctantly relents after many months. HIMARS, Stingers, Patriots, Abrams tanks, F16s, now ATACMS! The list is long.

Biden is not acting like he is in it to win it.Last month's inflation numbers debunk President Biden’s State of the Union claim that inflation is under control—it’s not. Even more so in Alaska, but all across the country, basic necessities like groceries and gasoline are up 20-30% since 2021.History in the making! Dallas Seavey rolled into Nome this evening as the winningest musher in Iditarod history, claiming his 6th title in 9 days, 2 hours, and 16 minutes. Congratulations, Dallas, and best of luck to the remaining mushers and dog teams trekking north.Since President Biden assumed office, global chaos has spread, with the dictators from Russia, China, and Iran acting with greater impunity. In each of those four years, President Biden has proposed inflation-adjusted cuts to defense spending.

The President's latest budget proposal thrusts the United States into even more dangerous territory—it puts the United States on track for our defense spending to drop below three percent of GDP for only the fourth time since World War II, which occurred in the years following the end of the Cold War.

The President proposes using budget gimmicks and accounting tricks to spend billions above spending caps for non-defense programs, but makes significant cuts to, among other programs, the Missile Defense Agency and our submarine fleet, and slashes new orders of fighter jets—including F-35s. Meanwhile, he’s funding more than one hundred million dollars to cater to his far-left base—including a diversity, equity, and inclusion office in the Pentagon that has nothing to do with winning wars and lethality.

If there ever was a time for this White House to reverse course on these weak defense proposals and deter global aggression, it is now. Jimmy Carter did this in his last year in office. We need our Commander in Chief to lead. We need a defense budget that reflects global threats—with real increases, not cuts, that improve our military readiness, and project strength, not weakness, in an increasingly dangerous world.Team Alaska is in the building!! #awg2024 https://t.co/JX8SxWRm9HJulie and I are glad to be in the Mat-Su for the opening ceremonies of the Arctic Winter Games! Go Team Alaska!! #awg2024 https://t.co/FDIpQHWudN56. That is the number of times this administration has chosen to side with Lower 48 extremists over Alaskans. Tonight, I hope President Biden announces a cease fire in his war against Alaskan working families. Unfortunately, that appears unlikely.

Instead, I fear the President is likely to claim credit for “Bidenomics.”  He will likely boast about how good the economy is doing, and condescendingly lecture us, once again, about how good we supposedly have it. I have news for President Biden: Alaskans aren’t buying it.

It is likely the President mentions the crisis at our southern border as well. This would be an improvement from the past years where he has ignored the crisis entirely, but he must do more than just talk. President Biden’s actions created this crisis, and President Biden, alone, has the power to solve this crisis. I hope he announces steps tonight to do so.

Lastly, I hope the President addresses the increasingly dangerous world we find ourselves in. Unfortunately today, if you look around the world, you see chaos. A lot of that, in my view, has been driven by the Biden administration's weakness in leveraging many of these strategic advantages: including our lethal military and energy dominance. Since the botched withdrawal in Afghanistan more than two years ago, our enemies have smelled weakness coming from this White House. Tonight, I hope the President gets tougher and starts working to reestablish the deterrence that America has lost under this President’s watch.

As I said in my legislative address just two weeks ago, Alaskans are resilient: Time and time again, our state has gone to battle against doomsdayers and road-blockers, we have done what others said couldn’t be done, when we work together. Even with this administration, we are the big state that could. Working together, with a sense of Alaskan optimism, we will continue to achieve where others think we will fail.If there's an Iranian spy ship providing targeting information to the Houthis to kill American sailors, why aren't we sinking those ships? https://t.co/b5lY3Q9GzdIn @SenateCommerce, I pressed @NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy to commit to continue working w/ my office and the FAA on our critically important FAA Alaska Safety Initiative—including its recommendation for robust investments in our infrastructure-poor state. https://t.co/c5fWBY96z2No other state has been targeted as much as ours.

I asked @SVACGOP witnesses if they’re getting the word out to #CampLejeune Marines &amp; their families on caps preventing law firms from charging exorbitant fees in these water contamination cases. https://t.co/z6lGUikN9tSo much for deterring Iran and the Houthis. On Friday, the Iranian-backed Houthis once again launched a massive barrage of 28 drones and missiles in the Red Sea, trying to sink American ships. These terrorists are trying every day to kill US sailors from places like Alaska and North Dakota, and at some point, they might succeed—one of their missiles could sneak past our missile defenses and sink a vessel. Iranian spy ships are providing the Houthis with targeting information to sink American ships and kill U.S. sailors and Marines. This is a fact, and yet Joe Biden lets them do this with zero consequences. Today, just as I did last week in a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, I call on the president to take real action on deterring Iran before it’s too late. He needs to tell Iran that the next Houthi missile or drone launched at an American ship will result in the sinking of Iran’s spy ships that target our Navy. That this hasn’t already happened, with so many American lives on the line, is simply the continuation of the Biden administration’s Iran-appeasement policy.https://t.co/gqsmafSZsvhttps://t.co/b5lY3Q9GzdIf you look around the world, you see chaos.

Under his leadership, we achieved historic wins—vital tax reforms that super-charged economic and job growth; rebuilding our military; energy independence, including opening ANWR after a 40-year effort; achieving a generational shift in the federal judiciary with principled, textualist judges—most importantly, on the U.S. Supreme Court. And when the current Majority Leader tried to blow up the legislative filibuster, Sen.

As Senator Murkowski and I wrote in a letter to the FTC last September, the fact that this merger could result in grocery store closures and higher prices in Alaska—a state that already has some of the highest prices for food and basic goods in the country—had many Alaskans very concerned. We demanded that the FTC conduct a rigorous analysis to ensure that Alaskans would not be negatively impacted by this merger. In that analysis, the FTC found that the merger would likely reduce competition and raise prices—putting further strain on working families in our state who are being crushed by the high inflation caused by the Biden administration’s policies.

I appreciate and support the FTC’s thorough analysis and decision to take action to block this merger for the benefit of Alaskans.Congrats to Cody Barber and Brett Lapham, brothers-in-law from Willow, on winning the 2024 Iron Dog!

His murder—and, let's be clear: he was murdered—underscores the danger of the world in which we’re living and the brutality of the Putin regime. But it also underscores a huge vulnerability for the dictators of the world—Putin, the ayatollahs in Iran, and Xi Jinping: They fear their own people. 

Navalny had millions of Russians who looked up to him and wanted him to be an elected leader. As Putin was heading into his elections in the next several weeks, he decided to kill Navalny. The fact that dictators around the world fear their own people is a vulnerability that we have to work harder to exploit in our fight against authoritarian aggression.RT @DCTwining: Strong start to #MSC2024 with ⁦@IRIglobal⁩ Chairman ⁦@SenDanSullivan⁩, ⁦@NATO⁩ Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, EU Commis…This bill invests billions of dollars in American munitions, stockpiles, and production capacity.

Authoritarian dictators—Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin and the Ayatollahs in Iran—are on the march and working together across the globe to weaken and challenge America’s national security and that of our allies. 

Our ability to defend our nation has dramatically atrophied due to the Biden administration’s lack of seriousness on national security issues and America’s declining capacity to produce weapons. The primary focus of this legislation is to enhance America’s industrial capacity to build weapons systems and produce ammunition. This has to be our number one priority during these dangerous times. 

Tens of billions of dollars will go to our country’s capacity to rapidly produce an entire array of weapons—everything from nuclear submarines to 155-millimeter artillery rounds. That’s why I believe this bill should be called the ‘Revitalizing America’s Defense Industrial Base’ supplemental. 

Helping our allies defeat unprovoked authoritarian aggression by providing them much-needed weapons and intelligence is also critical. The citizens of Israel, Taiwan, and Ukraine all face true existential threats posed by dictators that want to crush them. 

I was heartened to see 70 U.S. senators come together to support this important legislation that will bolster our defense industrial base, create thousands of good-paying jobs, and help America and our allies deter authoritarian aggression and, if necessary, fight and win wars.RT @frankthorp: “One of our greatest strengths relative to our adversaries—China, Russia, Iran, North Korea—is our vast network of allies,…RT @frankthorp: News: Sen Dan Sullivan (R-AK) will be the new lead GOP Senator on the upcoming congressional delegation trip to the Munich…RT @DCTwining: “Deterrence is not divisible; American credibility is not divisible,” said @SenDanSullivan . “You can’t say, ‘We’re going to…There are numerous reasons why the national security supplemental we’re debating in the Senate should unify Republicans.

Thank you, Ayesha and the amazing @SpecialOlymAK team, for making the long trek to DC! #SOHillDay https://t.co/fubey5B3D9On day one, the Biden administration created this border crisis with their self-imposed open border policies. In the last three years, Americans in all fifty states have felt the impacts of this administration’s decision to do nothing, month after month, year after year, as the crisis on our southern border quickly became the largest invasion of illegal aliens in American history. It is a humanitarian, health, and national security crisis of epic proportions. President Biden has refused to act and use the tools already at his disposal, and now, Senate Democrats have refused to force his hand.

I intend to vote no to advance the current proposed border legislation. First, the time frame we have been provided to evaluate this very complex border legislation is inadequate. Despite the hard work of Senator Lankford, this bill appears to give broad discretion to the President, leaving open the possibility that President Biden will not secure the border as intended by this bill. Indeed, the last three years are strong evidence that he won’t.The Chinese PLA Navy has grown to 370 ships, compared to America’s 291-vessel Navy.

https://t.co/Min7cOpnywIran and its terrorist proxies have been escalating tensions in the Middle East for months—not the United States. To reestablish deterrence, we need to inflict pain on the Iranian leadership, both through kinetic actions, but also with non-military tools. https://t.co/Nr4CwEjHv6The Houthis right now are targeting American vessels with Iranian weapons and Iranian intel from Iranian warships. Those Iranian ships should be sunk. These are the kinds of actions that will begin to ramp up deterrence. https://t.co/6FLT2yPdW5The Biden administration’s response to these attacks—delayed for almost a week, and now signaling where our military will and will not strike—has been disastrous to the point of being dangerous.

What would be more effective is to send the message to Iran’s leadership that if the Houthis continue to use Iranian missiles and Iranian intelligence from Iranian spy ships to target U.S. Navy vessels in the Red Sea, we will sink those Iranian spy ships. That is how you begin to reestablish deterrence.

The Biden administration needs a sustained, multi-faceted strategy that also focuses on non-military actions—in particular, reimposing the comprehensive sanctions against the Iranian oil and gas sector that proved to be so effective during the Trump administration.RT @RepRyanZinke: Congratulations to Alaska Senator @SenDanSullivan  on his retirement from decades of service in the Marine Corps.

This strike, and the 150+ attacks our forces have sustained in recent months, shows the dangers of the Biden administration’s appeasement of Iran in the past three years and the administration’s total failure to enact deterrence in the region—something I’ve been pushing to reverse for years.

Unlike @POTUS, her vision for the future of America is clear and reflects the American dream that you and I believe in..@POTUS using his office to angrily shout lies and partisan attacks was beneath the presidency.

It is past time for the Biden administration to restore order at the border.President Biden inherited a secure border and chose to allow murderous drug cartels to turn it into a turnstile for millions of illegal aliens and deadly drugs.

Pretending to care about border security now reeks of political desperation, not sincere concern.RT @SenateGOP: Biden took office and immediately declared war on American energy. https://t.co/FGX9ZG7B2DPresident Biden has been attacking domestic energy production since his first day in office.

He canceled the Keystone XL Pipeline.

Canceled oil and gas leases on federal lands.

Halted liquified natural gas exports.

These attacks on American energy must stop.America could be energy independent with affordable energy and good paying jobs but President Biden has chosen to push Green New Deal nonsense that is driving up the cost of living and crushing Wyoming.Bidenomics is costing the average Wyoming household more than $1,100 a month.

No matter how President Biden tries to spin it, the people of Wyoming do not believe the economy is working for them.The Senate will be worse off without @SenatorSinema.

She is truly a legislators’ legislator but more importantly, a kind and caring friend who will be sorely missed.RT @SenWestCaucus: Not to sound like a broken record, but gas prices are once again on the rise because of President Biden's Green New Deal…Bidenflation is forcing families across Wyoming to pay at least $1,000 per month more under this administration’s costly policies.

Rent  ⬆️ 20%
Food ⬆️ 20%
Gas   ⬆️ 30%

Numbers don’t lie; Bidenomics isn’t helping people in Wyoming, it’s failing them. https://t.co/L3ILONJfArHappy 307 Day Wyoming! https://t.co/uZcS2fDJdLI am joining @TeamCavuto on @FoxBusiness at 12:15, tune in!There is no one in the U.S. Senate I respect more than my good friend and Wyoming counterpart, @SenJohnBarrasso.

I will continue to fight back against this blatant government overreach to ensure crypto is not unfairly targeted by the Biden admin.Wyoming’s economy depends on land access as our landscapes generate income for multiple industries and draw millions of people to the Cowboy State each year.

The people of Wyoming will always be the best stewards of our land, not activists and certainly not foreign nationals.It is an honor to serve in the Senate with Leader McConnell. https://t.co/iCVuyLAuRwToday, SCOTUS will hear arguments in Garland v Cargill to decide the legality of @ATFHQ's bump stock ban.

I filed an amicus brief urging the court to reject this attempt by the ATF to grant itself the authority to infringe on the rights of law-abiding Wyoming gun owners.Electric vehicles are too expensive and not reliable enough for the rugged terrain and weather of Wyoming.

President Biden's EV mandate needs to go.RT @SenWestCaucus: America does not have to rely on China for the majority of critical minerals.

We have the resources beneath our feet to…If Europe cannot buy American energy, they will turn to Russia, Iran and others.

President Biden needs to reverse his disastrous LNG export pause and allow Wyoming energy producers to power the world. https://t.co/6dp8N0ug8OThis reeks of political desperation.

If President Biden were serious about the border, he would finish building the wall and bring back Remain in Mexico and other highly-successful Trump-era policies instead of flying down to the border for a photo-op.RT @SenWestCaucus: The Ninth Circuit Court’s decision to vacate an unprecedented ruling from a district court blocking federal coal leasing…Illegal immigrants are being given a cell phone by President Biden, a pre-loaded debit card by New York and health care by California.

Why are taxpayers being forced to foot the bill for all these government programs exclusively offered to illegal aliens?I am very encouraged by the Ninth Circuit’s decision to reverse the disastrous Obama-era rule effectively blocking coal leasing on federal lands.

Wyoming coal not only powers our country, but enables our nation to power the world.

https://t.co/iCmT9T8uTHI am thrilled the Department of Energy suspended its crypto asset mining usage survey. 

DOE should never pick winners and losers with who can access the energy grid.RT @SenWestCaucus: One-size fits all big government mandates are never the solution and President Biden's EV mandate is no exception.

32,LindseyGrahamSC,"Very sorry to hear that seven World Central Kitchen employees were killed during an Israeli military operation in Gaza.
 
Israel was right to take responsibility for this and launch an investigation into how such a tragedy could have happened.
 
These brave workers were assisting their fellow man at great personal risk, and their lives must be celebrated. World Central Kitchen has done a tremendous amount of good not just in Gaza but throughout the world.
https://t.co/YyKUduQlfYEncouraged to hear that Speaker Johnson will take up Ukraine aid when Congress reconvenes next week.
 
This innovative approach includes:
 
➡️ the REPO Act, which goes after Russian oligarch assets to pay for the reconstruction of Ukraine
➡️ making portions of the aid a loan helping the American taxpayer
➡️ pushing increased natural gas exports, which is good business for America and a blow to Russia
 
This proposal or something similar, when combined with border security, would be a winning package for all concerned.
https://t.co/GpHshKTYzzThis morning on Meet the Press, Congressman Bacon laid out a way forward in the House on Ukraine by focusing on lethal aid and border security combined with President Trump’s loan approach.  

This way forward, as described by Congressman Bacon, would have substantial bipartisan support in the Senate. 

I also could not agree more that the Biden Administration should be required to send long range ATACMS as part of an effort to give Ukraine more offensive capability. 

The Biden Administration has been painfully slow in providing game-changing weapons. This aid package should insist that dynamic is fixed. 

I am very optimistic that not only will Ukraine get the military aid they need, they will also be given long-range weapons to go on offense. 

Finally, the American taxpayer will be considered in this endeavor, as we are $34 trillion in debt. 

No reason we can’t execute this quickly when Congress reconvenes.Today we celebrate Christ conquering death and providing the gift of eternal life. The holiest day in the Christian faith should be a time of reflection on what is truly important. 

Wishing you and your family a blessed Easter Sunday.After numerous trips to Israel and Saudi Arabia, I am hopeful normalization is still possible. 

However, there is much work to be done before normalization can occur, starting with essential agreements between the United States and Saudi Arabia. 

With all due respect to President Biden, when it comes to normalization, we have a lot to do in a short amount of time.RT @AmirOhana: My good friend @LindseyGrahamSC has backed Israel's righteous cause with sincere devotion since day one. 

We met today for…RT @gantzbe: I met today with true friend of Israel, Senator @LindseyGrahamSC on his fifth visit to Israel since October 7th. 

I conveyed…Just heard of my dear friend Joe Lieberman’s passing.
 
As I am just now leaving Israel, so many emotions. This is devastatingly sad. 
 
I feel fortunate to have been in his presence, traveling the world in support of America’s interests as we saw it.
 
To Hadassah, I know your heart is broken, but please understand your legion of friends love you dearly.  To the Lieberman family, we will be with you through this journey.
 
I look forward to sharing more thoughts about this wonderful man and the incredible life he lived. 
 
The good news, he is in the hands of the loving God. The bad news, John McCain is giving him an earful about how screwed up things are.
 
Rest in peace, my dear friend.
 
From the Last Amigo.RT @TOIAlerts: Live update: In Jerusalem, Lindsey Graham calls claims Israel starving Gaza ‘BS,’ says Hamas to blame https://t.co/DVdnaYFS7xIt is blood libel and BS to say Israel is using starvation as a tool of war. https://t.co/nqtgaK7NtOIf Hamas is still standing after October 7, the Ayatollah and his henchmen will be celebrating in Iran. https://t.co/pKjrKCAUjyThe destruction of Hamas is non-negotiable. https://t.co/zcDLwpBe3TI’m here with Israel’s elected leader, Prime Minister @netanyahu, to say:

We have Israel’s back. https://t.co/ogTeXlQW05The world is a very dangerous place. To those who advocate for abandoning Ukraine and letting Putin have his way, even more chaos will be released if your advice is followed. For the most part, these same people advocated for withdrawing from Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria.

Letting terrorists roam free and thugs like Putin take other countries by force always comes back to haunt the civilized world.

When it comes to national security, weakness and isolationism are a formula for disaster.We should be hitting ISIS-K targets in Afghanistan hard, disrupting their operations before it’s too late.

We need to gain operational control of the border now before it’s too late.I very much condemn the horrific and barbaric ISIS-K attack on innocent concertgoers in Moscow. My sympathies are with the families of those injured and killed. 

This appalling loss of life in the name of Islamic jihad is yet another reminder of the dangerous world in which we live and the growth of terrorist organizations after the United States’ disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan. 

I hope we will work closely with the international community to help explain this attack and prevent future attacks. I equally hope that Putin will not use this horrific attack to justify further outrageous attacks against Ukraine. That would be ill-advised.Very encouraged to hear the House will take up Ukraine and other aid provisions after the recess. I believe there will be significant bipartisan support for Ukraine aid in the form of a no-interest, waivable loan. 
 
Ukraine has the potential to be a very wealthy country as it is sitting on trillions of dollars of critical minerals. 
 
Putin cannot be allowed to rewrite the map of Europe or seize Ukrainian valuable assets to enrich his regime by force of arms. 
 
President Trump’s loan proposal is a common sense solution to a real problem and time is of the essence. 
 
https://t.co/ChpoxpeEP9It’s one thing to be antisemitic, it’s another thing to be dumb and antisemitic. 

Criticizing my comments in support of Israel by saying I’m in the pocket of the Jewish lobby proves my point better than I could. https://t.co/MMgWSou8lCThis narrative of people being “owned by the Jews” is not only offensive to the Jewish people but those who support Israel. 

If you’re trying to make me change, it won’t work.It is unbelievable to me that the Biden Administration continues to tolerate attacks against American naval vessels and international shipping by Iranian proxies. 
 
When it comes to our men and women in the Navy, the Biden Administration is letting them down.
 
When it comes to enforcing freedom of navigation for commercial shipping, the Biden Administration is AWOL.
 
When it comes to containing Iran, the Biden Administration has only emboldened the Ayatollah and his henchmen. 
 
This needs to stop. 
https://t.co/RKespODM2dVery sad to hear of the passing of my good friend, Richard Quinn. 

Richard was exceptionally bright and had a keen political mind. 

He helped me get my start in South Carolina politics and was instrumental in building the modern Republican Party.

Richard was a force in South Carolina politics for decades. My prayers are with the entire Quinn family.RT @sbaprolife: ""Pick a week in the birthing process where you would limit abortion — just any week.""

""You won't, because you cant.""

Than…It has been a long-standing position of mine to give great deference to executive appointments, particularly judicial appointments, for both parties. 

However, it is clear to me that concerns about this nomination are widespread, not just among Republicans in the Senate.

I urge President Biden to seriously listen to these concerns and withdraw Mr. Mangi’s nomination.
https://t.co/8X7o0dwicMI had a very productive visit with President Zelensky and other Ukrainian officials about the state of the war and what lies ahead.

During my meeting with President Zelensky, I informed him that given the crisis at the United States’ southern border and our overwhelming debt, President Trump’s idea of turning aid from the United States into a no-interest, waivable loan is the most likely path forward. This is not only true for aid for Ukraine, but for other countries across the board. I reiterated that the House’s Ukraine aid legislation must include some American border security provisions.

I am also urging the Biden Administration to send longer-range artillery, accelerate F-16 training for the Ukrainians, and designate Russia a state sponsor of terrorism under U.S. law.

Once Ukraine gets back on its feet, they will be an economic powerhouse because of their access to mass deposits of critical minerals, oil and gas.

It is clear Ukrainians appreciate the United States’ support. I know Americans want to help our friends and allies, but I also believe we must consider our economic situation as we help others.The Biden-Schumer wrecking ball continues on foreign policy.

With President Biden’s approval, Senator Schumer called for the dissolution of the democratically-elected government of Israel while refusing to support legislation declaring Putin’s autocracy a state sponsor of terrorism.
 
I wish President Biden and Senator Schumer were as tough on Putin  – who just murdered Navalny  – as they are on Israel’s democracy – who fights for its very survival.I believe Iran is directly responsible for the turmoil we’re seeing in Israel and Gaza.

The reason: an end to the Arab-Israeli conflict is a nightmare for the Ayatollah. https://t.co/mKcuCSMcIqWe live in a world that is literally upside down.

We must pledge our unconditional support to the state of Israel to finish the job and eradicate Hamas. https://t.co/1m2bZdljoKSimilar to what America did when we were attacked by Japan in WWII and Al-Qaeda on 9/11, Israel is rightfully defending itself after being brutally attacked on Oct. 7th.

They have every right to defend themselves and see through to complete and total victory.

The military destruction of Hamas is non-negotiable.About to head to the floor to speak in support of Israel.

Tune in: https://t.co/W2XDv8HYjnI worked with @SenKatieBritt, @SenatorTimScott and others to introduce the Laken Riley Act.

Ms. Riley’s murder is likely a result of the Biden Administration’s open border policy.

Senator Schumer should bring the Laken Riley Act to the Senate floor for a vote immediately.
https://t.co/i27UlBEItpCNN was forced to issue a correction for smearing @SenKatieBritt.

Katie is exactly right. President Biden’s border policies are a nightmare for our country.
https://t.co/HuaCd2tCleIt’s time to open up the American courtroom for those who have been wronged by social media companies.

The days of Big Tech having a hold on Congress are almost over:

We’re going to kick their a**. https://t.co/2a5tV0NBFVCongratulations to President @realDonaldTrump and his team for securing the Republican nomination for President for a third time. This is historic in so many ways, and was one of the best run campaigns in political history. 

On to victory in the General Election in November!The latest report from the global nuclear watchdog @iaeaorg indicates Iran continues to deny access to nuclear inspectors. Further, the IAEA reports Iran has increased its stockpile of 60% enriched uranium.

It is only a small leap between 60% enriched uranium and 90% weapons-grade uranium.

The Biden Administration is fiddling while Iran marches toward a nuclear weapon. Very dangerous.
https://t.co/SQhzojdxvDToday, along with the rest of the world, I learned with great sadness that Itay Chen, a young Israeli American serving in the IDF, was killed on October 7 by Hamas during their vicious attack on the State of Israel.

My heart breaks for Itay’s entire family, especially Hagit and Ruby, his mother and father. I have met with them many times, and his father was recently my guest at the State of the Union.

It is my understanding that Hamas possesses Itay’s body. I will continue to work with the Biden Administration and others to recover his remains and pursue the release of other hostages.

We must never forget the real enemy is Hamas.President Biden terminated Remain in Mexico and stopped deportations by executive action. 
 
He has no one to blame but himself for this crisis. 
 
By simply reinstating Remain in Mexico - with the stroke of a pen - a large part of the problem could be solved according to Border Patrol.  
 
No excuses. Act now.We're trillions of dollars in debt. 

President Trump is trying to do two things -- help our friends overseas but keep Americans in mind by asking these countries to pay us back if they can. 

No one wants to help Ukraine more than I do, but we must think about America first. https://t.co/jkwcnrvQGGThis ruling is nonsensical. 

When it comes to the prosecution of President Trump and others in Fulton County, Georgia, politics hangs heavy in the air.

https://t.co/kuBurWO8yjThe charges brought by Fulton County DA Willis and the bizarre decision by the judge not to remove her for an obvious appearance of impropriety reinforces the narrative that there is a two-tiered system of justice for President Trump and those around him.

I am hopeful either the Georgia State Senate or the state’s Attorney General will look into this matter.

Today is a sad day for Georgia.If you're worried about the world being on fire right now, you're right.

If you think Joe Biden's policies lack deterrence and he's weak in the eyes of our enemies, you're right. 

If you want to get the world back in order, you'd better vote for Donald Trump in November. https://t.co/VujzlLWRGdIf there was ever an election in the history of America that deserves a debate between the two candidates, it's this election.

If Joe Biden is really ""energetic,"" he needs to get on stage and debate Donald Trump. https://t.co/m1KhHCjS2aWhen President Biden is talking about Prime Minister Netanyahu and not Hamas, he’s got it backward. 

We should be talking about red lines for Iran, not Israel. 

We should be all-in for helping Israel and trying to help fix the humanitarian crisis. 

But we shouldn’t say or do anything that would empower our enemy.The man who killed Laken Riley was paroled into the United States from Venezuela. 

➡️ President Biden is apologizing for calling Laken Riley’s murderer an illegal immigrant. 

➡️ President Trump went to Georgia to meet Ms. Riley’s family to apologize for a country that allowed a killer to get in. 

The difference couldn’t be more obvious.I’ll be joining @kwelkernbc on @MeetThePress this morning — tune in. 

Meet the Press airs today on the NBC-TV network. Find what time to watch in your location here: https://t.co/lPM7Q07Gmw.@KatieBrittforAL was absolutely spot on and delivered a dynamite response to the #SOTU:

Joe Biden started the crisis at our southern border with the swipe of a pen and he can end it with a swipe of a pen too.

Our enemies are emboldened because of weak leadership by this President on the world stage.

Families are struggling to make ends meet due to the worst inflation in 40 years as a result of this President’s policies.

Our cities are less safe from rising crime and “weak on crime” policies.

It doesn’t have to be this way. The only way to change this is by electing @realDonaldTrump in November. The future of our nation depends on it.He wasn’t wrong. https://t.co/qejKdd7XRUThis is the State of Biden’s America. 

So sad.The good news is this will be President Biden’s last State of Union Rant.I’m looking forward to watching @KatieBrittForAL hold @JoeBiden’s feet to the fire following his SOTU address tonight.

I cannot not think of anyone more capable to hold the President accountable for his policy failures that have our world on fire, southern border in chaos, and economy in disarray.

I’ll be listening and hope everyone does the same.Tonight, Ruby Chen, the father of an American-Israeli hostage, will be my guest at the State of the Union. His son, Itay, is one of the eight Americans still being held hostage in Gaza.
 
Israel and the United States are doing everything we can to bring these hostages home.
 
Pray for their safe release.

The next appropriations package will be much more difficult, but I’m very pleased to see the House pass the first package that will help keep the government funded.
 
I am confident the Senate will pass this first package, and we will send this legislation to President Biden’s desk.I’m heading to the floor in just a few minutes to make a request for the Senate to immediately pass bipartisan legislation to protect children online.

The lack of accountability from Big Tech must end.

https://t.co/a2ipp05FK4First, congratulations to President Trump and his team for securing the 2024 Republican presidential nomination.  
 
This is an amazing political comeback. I believe President Trump is well-positioned to win the White House in 2024.
 
Ambassador Haley has a lot to be proud of. She has created many firsts in her quest for the Republican nomination and has acquired a significant following. I believe her decision to suspend her campaign is in the best interest of the party and is a chance to reset the 2024 presidential contest. I hope she will be able to support President Trump as he seeks to end the nightmare of the Biden presidency.
 
I am hoping that the party will soon unite and move forward together.
 
Ambassador Haley’s voice will be an important asset in this cause because she is well-equipped to make the case regarding the disastrous Biden presidency. This is truly an election conservatives cannot afford to lose.President Trump is on track to not only win the Republican nomination, but be elected as our next president in November. 

He enjoyed an overwhelming victory this Super Tuesday and is clearly the choice of Republican voters to be our standard bearer in 2024. 

Republicans believe President Trump was an effective president in his first term when it comes to everything conservatives care about.

I appreciate Ambassador Haley and all she has done for our state, country, and party, but I hope after tonight we can all unite behind President Trump to ensure the nightmare of the Biden presidency comes to an end.Companies like @ElectroluxUS are investing in America to help keep us strong. Being able to buy products made right here in South Carolina is a blessing.
 
Our world may be upside down as our country faces many concerns, but one thing is certain: Never bet against America! https://t.co/h0eAtRTZ8IThe effort to knock President Trump off the ballot was dangerous and unconstitutional.

I’m grateful the Supreme Court unanimously made the right decision for our nation.

More ⬇️
https://t.co/chOWep4rNeThe Supreme Court rightly ruled that actions by Trump-hating liberal judges and state officials to disqualify President Trump from being on a state presidential ballot were unconstitutional.
 
The Left’s hatred of President Trump is boundless. The efforts by Colorado, Maine, and other states to disqualify him from the 2024 presidential ballot were politically-driven election interference.
 
The Supreme Court unanimously rejected this ideological purge and set boundaries that will serve the country well going forward.I thoroughly encourage everyone to read Dr. Adelson’s speech about anti-Semitism and Israel's resolve to survive. Miriam’s compelling words capture the essence of the strength of the Israeli people and the times in which we live.

https://t.co/IRO9UJl56GPresident Trump was right to bring attention to the tragic death of Laken Riley. She was a nursing student who was allegedly killed by an illegal immigrant, Jose Ibarra, who was released into the country on parole by the Biden Administration.

This is a horrific tragedy that should have never happened. I, along with my Republican colleagues on the @SenJudiciaryGOP, are demanding answers from DHS @SecMayorkas.

Under the law, parole can only be granted if the applicant has an urgent humanitarian need or provides a significant public benefit to the United States. I want to see Ibarra’s case file to understand why he was paroled – on what basis and by whom?

The country and Laken Riley’s family deserve to know. Secretary Mayorkas: Provide this information immediately.

https://t.co/4H7noyXDHKI’m glad President Biden finally went to the border. 

Unfortunately, he is not visiting the hardest-hit areas or the communities that have been destroyed.

Missed opportunity or political negligence?RT @SenJudiciaryGOP: ""The GOP lawmakers requested Mayorkas provide information on how Ibarra was processed into the country and wrote that…If the Biden Administration doesn’t get serious about securing our southern border, more senseless tragedies will occur, and I fear we are headed for the next 9/11. https://t.co/ENMtgDcGDW.@JoeBiden is going to the border because he has to.

Mr. President: there’s a way to fix this, but you must have the will to do it.

Secure the border now. https://t.co/PQVKzlTNYqCongratulations to President Trump for a decisive win in the Michigan primary.  

I’m hoping that sooner rather than later the Republican presidential primary will end so we can unite with President Trump as our nominee.  He is the candidate who will defeat Joe Biden in the Fall and will get America back on track quickly.    

It is clear to me that the Republican Party faithful are behind President Trump in all corners of the country. It’s time to move on to the general election.By law, immigration parole may only be granted if there is an urgent humanitarian reason or a significant public benefit justifying the parole.

The Biden Administration must release the reasons why the UGA murder suspect was paroled into the U.S. in the first place. Who made the decision? Was there an urgent humanitarian reason, or did he provide a significant public benefit to the country?

This is great news for NATO and bad news for Putin.

Putin’s blunder in Ukraine keeps growing by the day:

1⃣ NATO is bigger.

2⃣ Putin is an indicted war criminal.

3⃣ Russia is further isolated.

4⃣ It is only a matter of time before more lethal aid is provided to Ukraine with the passage of the Trump loan package plus border security.I’m glad President Biden is going to the border on Thursday, but I fear it is just a photo-op. I am hopeful he will actually listen to our Border Patrol and reinstate the Trump-era policies, like Remain in Mexico, that worked.
 
On Thursday, a tale of two presidents will unfold. 
 
➡️ President Trump: Implemented policies to provide the country the most secure border in over 40 years. 

➡️ President Biden: Allowed a broken border to become an economic, social, and national security nightmare. 
 
https://t.co/xlPmmEdTxMAccording to reporting, the suspect charged with the murder of Augusta University student Laken Riley was paroled into the U.S. by the Biden Administration.

Under the immigration parole statute, parole may only be granted if there is an urgent humanitarian reason or a significant public benefit justifying the parole.

The Biden Administration must release the reasons in this case, if there were any, that justify why the suspect was paroled into the U.S. in the first place. Who made the decision? Was there an urgent humanitarian need, or did he provide a significant public benefit to the U.S.?

Are there any records at all?Let’s help our allies, but help ourselves too.

I’m all for helping Ukraine, Taiwan and Israel, but they should pay us back over time, if they can. 

That’s what it means to truly put America First. https://t.co/YQwZBsCal6My heart breaks for the family of Laken Riley. They are in my prayers.

It didn’t have to be this way. @JoeBiden’s failed policies are directly responsible for the death of this innocent girl.

We’ve been talking about securing our broken border for over two years. Enough is enough. It’s time to act.Senator McConnell’s announcement that he will not seek Republican leadership in the next Congress is truly a 'passing of the torch' moment for the U.S. Senate.

Senator McConnell will be remembered as one of the most effective leaders in the history of the U.S. Senate.No one in the Republican Party has echoed the themes of peace through strength – the Reagan model of national security – better than Senator Mitch McConnell.

He passionately believes in a strong America leading from the front and has been uncompromising in his view that we must deal with threats rather than wish them away.I look forward to continuing to work with Senator McConnell in the coming days and months as we address major challenges like securing the southern border and helping our friends in Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan.

There is much to be done, and I’m sure that Mitch will run through the finish line as Republican leader.

History will record that Senator Mitch McConnell made a substantial and positive impact on the state he loves and the nation he adores.The last thing Republicans will do is shut down fertility clinics and limit access to legal birth control.

Tune in!Glad to see Senator Schumer is in Ukraine. Hopefully he’ll commit to pushing bipartisan legislation designating Russia a state sponsor of terrorism under U.S. law.
 
This will group Russia with countries like Iran, Cuba, Syria, and North Korea. 
 
Putin’s Russia has earned this designation.
 
1️⃣ It will make it much harder for people and countries to do business with Putin.
 
2️⃣ It will open up the American courtroom to victims of his tyranny.
 
This will be far more effective than the sanctions announced today.

https://t.co/JAZkxclUSeAmerica cannot help others until we help ourselves.

Grateful that I had my friend @votetimscott by my side last week in Eagle Pass, TX to send a clear message to our colleagues and @JoeBiden:

It’s time to secure our southern border. https://t.co/eT8LTiVf4YAfter two years of war, the Biden Administration is still reluctant to call Putin out for the terrorist he is.
 
After all the destruction, brutality, rape, and murder at the hands of Putin’s Russia – well before the murder of Alexei Navalny – how is there even anything left to sanction?
 
These new so-called “crushing sanctions” will fail to deliver the intended results of making Russia a no-go zone.
 
The strongest way to send a signal to the world that Russia is a pariah is to designate Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism under U.S. law, like Iran, Cuba, Syria, and North Korea.
 
➡️ This designation is something Russia detests, Ukraine supports, and would make a difference.

➡️ Doing business with a state sponsor of terrorism under U.S. law comes at a heavy price.

➡️ Such a designation would allow victims of Putin’s Russia to use U.S. courts to seek justice.
 
Everything else is just talk.

https://t.co/0ZkXqXkVFeAfter three years of chaos, the Biden Administration is finally realizing President Trump had it right.

I’m confident that we will eventually help our allies. But, I’m not confident that we will help ourselves.

I chose to visit our border last week with @votetimscott over traveling to Munich because it’s important for lawmakers to understand what it is like to live in these border communities.

It’s time we get the situation at our border under control once and for all.I understand what happens if Putin wins in Ukraine.

However, many members of Congress do not seem to understand what is happening to America every single day at our southern border.

Count me in for helping Ukraine. But, we must help ourselves first.

It’s time to get our broken border under control.The death of Alexei Navalny can not go unanswered by the international community.

@JoeBiden, you said Russia would pay a price if they hurt Navalny:

Keep your word and designate Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism. https://t.co/15PoMT56BRAsking NATO nations to meet their obligation of 2% doesn’t mean we’re inviting Russia to invade Ukraine.

President Trump is right, it’s time our allies pay up. https://t.co/hA62DOdVcWThe two things @votetimscott and I heard on our trip to the border the most this past week were this:

Let’s go back to ‘Remain in Mexico’ and re-institute Title 42.

If we do these things, we’ll be much closer to achieving a secure border again. https://t.co/Vt6RMp5dnfRT @politico: Lindsey Graham: Time to designate Russia a state sponsor of terrorism https://t.co/LS0XQRntLbThere goes all my rubles!
https://t.co/vCYxZr7lVWI call your “terrorists and extremists” bid and raise you “State Sponsor of Terrorism under U.S. law.”

Believe it or not, 2024 is going to be a bad year for Putin’s Russia.

✅More aid to Ukraine

✅More high-end weapons that can reach out and touch the Russian occupiers.

✅Designation of Russia as a State Sponsor of Terrorism

✅Expansion of NATOPresident Biden: You want aid to Ukraine and other allies? Then get serious about border security. 

While you’re in California, go to Jacumba on the southern border.

There are thousands of people from all over the world walking around border fencing, making a mockery of our sovereignty.I understand the need to fundraise, but you’re the Commander in Chief. Visit the southern border in California. Then you will understand why many of us insist on border security legislation that is more robust than the bipartisan Senate proposal.RT @SenatorTimScott: .@LindseyGrahamSC and I are calling on President Biden to stop playing politics and secure the southern border.

He op…Today, I visited our southern border in Eagle Pass, TX, along with my friend @votetimscott, to witness the #BidenBorderCrisis first hand. 

Senator Scott and I came down here to listen and learn, but there was one thing we heard over and over:

The situation at our border will not get fixed until we enact serious policy changes.

We will not rest until we fix the self inflicted disaster at our border once and for all. 

The bipartisan senate bill, without the Remain in Mexico policy change, is woefully inadequate to the task at hand. Everyone we met with said going back to Remain in Mexico is a key ingredient to fixing the problem. 

I encourage all of my colleagues to come down here to listen and learn.The Democratic position of allowing abortion on demand up to the moment of birth is extreme, and out of line with the civilized world. 

Americans are overwhelmingly opposed to late term abortions when the unborn child is capable of feeling pain. 

If media reports are accurate that President Trump would support limiting abortions at 16 weeks, the fourth month, with exceptions for rape, incest or life of the mother, then he has landed squarely where most Americans reside regarding limiting late term abortions.

It is now time for President Biden and Democratic leaders in the House and Senate to articulate what limits they would put on abortions, if at all. 

Simply put, President Biden needs to tell America when he supports limitations and under what circumstance. Be specific.

https://t.co/r38pQHWQJ4It’s no secret that our southern border is an unmitigated disaster.

If the American people really want a secure border, they must fire @JoeBiden in November and elect @realDonaldTrump. https://t.co/IdpwBfMlcXOnly @JoeBiden can put this special counsel report to rest.

As Senator Schumer lauds this Senate supplemental bill, the Speaker has rightly chosen to say this bill goes nowhere in the House. 

America’s border is a disaster. We are $34 trillion in debt. It is time to help our allies while also helping ourselves. 

This bill is rightly DOA in the House. I support the Trump plan to make the supplemental a loan.My statement on my decision to vote 'No' on the National Security Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2024: https://t.co/k1URUaWplQPresident Trump’s idea about making U.S. supplemental foreign aid a loan is spot on.

WATCH: https://t.co/W2XDv8HYjn🚨At 3:30 p.m., I'll speak on the Senate floor about prematurely ending debate on legislation to secure the border. 

Watch live: https://t.co/W2XDv8HYjnThe process being used on the floor of the United States Senate - to go to Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan aid before adequately addressing border concerns - is going to end up costing us votes.

Many Republicans, including me, believe we must do all we can within reason to secure our border before we can help other countries.

We have given very little time and attention to a public debate about what legislative measures would help secure our border. I, along with many others, have ideas that would provide better border security.

While I want to help Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, we must help America first.

The way we are ending debate on border security and starting debate on foreign aid is going to cost votes, not gain votes, in support of Ukraine.I will be voting no on cloture on the national security supplemental package minus the border security provisions because I believe we have not done all we can to secure our southern border.

I have ideas to improve the border provisions and I think they are worthy of consideration by the Senate.

I am insistent that we continue our efforts to secure our own border before we turn to helping other countries. I enthusiastically support Ukraine, Taiwan and Israel, but as I have been saying for months now, we must protect America first.

I believe there is much more we can do in this regard and I insist that we try. We should not rush this process because Senators want to go on a break – it is too important.Welcome news that American forces recently eliminated a Kata’ib Hezbollah commander who had a hand in orchestrating the death of three American soldiers in Jordan.
https://t.co/Hz3c20fcVS

However, this strike occurred in Iraq. Unfortunately, in my opinion, this will not change the game when it comes to future attacks on American interests and international shipping.
 
The only thing that will change the game is if Iran feels the heat – not their proxies, which includes Kata’ib Hezbollah. It is long past time to strike oil infrastructure, Iranian spy ships,
 IRGC assets or things they value the most inside Iran.In a few minutes, I’ll be joining @SenBlumenthal to talk with @BretBaier on @FoxNews about last week’s Judiciary hearing on holding Big Tech accountable and the EARN IT Act, our legislation to protect kids online. 

Tune in.As I have repeatedly said, if these arrested migrants are the perpetrators in the brutal attack on our police officers, I expect them to be criminally processed and deported.

https://t.co/oPj913zUPBNow that the Senate’s national security supplemental text has been released, I look forward to the amendment process to try to improve the bill. Something this significant cannot be rushed and jammed through. It should be subject to a robust debate and amendment process in the Senate.

I am hopeful that Senator Schumer will allow an open amendment process to occur. If not, then the bill will die because of process.This issue is important to the American people. We must allow their voices to be heard when it comes to the Biden Border Disaster.

Finally, I very much appreciate what Senator Lankford and others have done to try to reform asylum, immigration parole, and expedited removal. Like many others, I am open-minded on steps we can take to make the bill stronger. That can only come through the amendment process."

We must get serious about combatting these threats before November – too much is at stake.There’s still a proposal on the table to expand the Child Tax Credit, immediately lifting hundreds of thousands of kids out of poverty.

It’s a no-brainer. We should get it done.This week marks 14 years of the Affordable Care Act! For over a decade, the ACA has saved lives and cut costs for Americans.

Continued communication is essential, so I’m closely watching the outcome of this historic case.Prices are coming down, stocks are staying high, and unemployment is still at historic lows.
 
Every country’s economy was rocked by COVID, but we’ve steadied the ship and come out stronger by building an economic recovery that focuses on growing the middle class.I’m disappointed the House still hasn't passed aid to Ukraine.

We look weaker and less trustworthy with every week we delay on getting this done. House Republicans should be jumping at the chance to carry on Reagan’s legacy by countering Russian authoritarianism.Virginia has already secured over $148 million for targeted projects across the Commonwealth for things like new affordable housing developments and domestic violence shelters.

President Biden’s policies have been hurting our country for over 3 years. Senate Republicans are ready to get this country back on track.President Biden is calling for ‘unification’ in the most divisive way possible. His vision for America is not the path our country should be on. It’s time to return conservative values to the White House. #SOTUFACT: CBP Agents seized over 27,000 pounds of fentanyl at our southern border in 2023, and that’s only what they were able to catch. Having an open border is a pathway for fentanyl to come into the US, and ignoring this fact is harming every community in America.#MikeChecks #SOTUFACT: There have been 9 million illegal crossings into the United States since President Biden took office. This is over 10 times the population of South Dakota. Contrary to what Pres. Biden says - the border is wide open. #MikeChecks #SOTUFACT: Secretary Mayorkas has said that over 85% of migrants at the southern border are being released into the United States. #MikeChecks #SOTUFACT: President Biden could secure our border right now using section 212F of the INA, which allows Presidents to suspend the entry of all aliens when their entry would be detrimental to the interests of the United States. #MikeChecks #SOTUShrinkflation is not happening due to corporations. Shrinkflation is happening because nobody can afford to produce or buy anything thanks to Bidenomics. #MikeChecks #SOTUFACT: Prices have risen 17.9% since President Biden took office. Americans can’t afford Bidenomics. #MikeChecks #SOTUFACT: Last year, South Dakotans spent over $900 more per month in living expenses than before President Biden took office. While Pres. Biden tries to spin this, South Dakotans know the truth. #MikeChecks #SOTUI asked Fed Chair Jay Powell about the lasting effects of Bidenomics - including high prices becoming the new normal in our country.

We need a return to conservative and common sense leadership in the White House.Under President Biden, we have a border crisis, a nearly 18% price increase in consumer goods, weak national security and no plan to get America back on track. 

Disappointed, but unfortunately not at all surprised.As @POTUS gives his #StateOfTheUnion, follow along with #MikeChecks to fact check the information that President Biden will try to spin tonight.

https://t.co/yEjoWIp86gSouth Dakota farmers and ranchers work tirelessly to produce the safest, highest quality and most affordable beef in the world.

Paraguay, on the other hand, has historically struggled to contain outbreaks of foot and mouth disease.Consumers across America should be able to confidently feed their families beef that they know has met the rigorous standards required in the United States.The Indian Health Service made a commitment to care for tribal members across the US, and they need to honor that commitment.

I introduced the PRC Improvement Act to require IHS to reimburse tribal members for care sought outside of IHS in a timely manner:https://t.co/31KEFa0f2UBecause of the strict standards for PRC claims, approved claims are few and far between. As such, it’s crucial that IHS reimburses tribal members for outside care once it’s approved.I’m pleased to introduce this legislation, which would hold IHS accountable to make certain they get their work done and follow their mission of providing health care for tribal members.I will be voting no on tomorrow’s cloture vote for the Senate border security deal.

They think we aren’t paying attention. We are. And this is exactly why we’re demanding border security measures in the next supplemental aid package.Secretary Mayorkas said that over 85% of migrants at the southern border are being released into the U.S.

Great to talk with law enforcement &amp; public safety leaders in La Crosse about our mission to save lives. https://t.co/Gfo6ibsbuoRegardless of how you are traveling, everyone should be safe on our roads. I’m proud to help honor Sarah’s legacy with this bill and give our local communities the tools they need to make our streets safer for bikers and pedestrians. https://t.co/4gZOTAb07EOur small businesses are the heart of our communities and the key to our local economies' success. I am glad to see the funding I delivered helping entrepreneurs grow their businesses, expand opportunities, and move our Made in Wisconsin economy forward.
https://t.co/EcHHhy6mqRThis is the impact of taking on big drug companies and lowering the cost of inhalers to $35/month. 

I am happy to hear from Wisconsinites who can, literally, breathe a little easier knowing they can get their lifesaving inhalers at an affordable price! https://t.co/JnqetIkdszHomeownership is out of reach for too many Wisconsinites, and we need to lower costs for working families looking to put down roots in our communities. I’m working to make that a reality. https://t.co/G2aOUDkfvbIf big corporations like Amazon want to operate in Wisconsin, they need to play by the rules and give their workers the benefits they are owed. I’m glad to see these Wisconsinites getting the respect and dignity they deserve.
https://t.co/zwitYW9nRQI voted for the Inflation Reduction Act because I knew it would create &amp; support good-paying jobs and move our clean energy economy forward, and that’s just what we’re doing!

I applaud this historic pledge to use union workers to build our state’s clean energy infrastructure. 👏First, they overturned Roe v. Wade. Now, they are coming for women’s right to get safe, effective prescription abortion medication.

This is simple: leave women and their health care alone.Judges need to stay out of women’s health care decisions.

Getting prescription abortion medication is a personal decision, not the Supreme Court’s or any politician’s. This is another step in Republicans' fight to ban abortion nationwide and I am having none of it.Wisconsinites who have been victims of scams or fraud shouldn’t have to pay twice &amp; be further penalized by the IRS for being victims. I voted against the 2017 tax bill that created this nightmare, &amp; now, I’m working to right this wrong for Wisconsinites facing these penalties. https://t.co/cSdmL4mQKwFor Wisconsinites like Vicki, a $35/month cap on inhalers will save them hundreds of dollars and ensure that the medication they need to stay alive will be within reach. https://t.co/z10RL7A1hhFor the Wisconsinites getting hit with this winter storm, I hope you are staying warm and stay safe if you are traveling!
https://t.co/Ehvoon0lU1Capping inhaler costs at $35/month could be all the difference for families struggling to afford the health care they need. I’ll call out price gouging wherever it exists because Americans shouldn’t be ripped off just to get their lifesaving medications. https://t.co/jG5SZGh9TASix years after the Parkland shooting, my heart continues to break for every family who has lost a loved one to gun violence.

Gun violence is the leading cause of death for American kids &amp; we can’t allow this to be our new norm. We must do more to end the gun violence epidemic.Happy Birthday, Affordable Care Act!

Passing the ACA &amp; providing Wisconsinites with affordable health care is one of my proudest accomplishments. As Republicans continue to try to repeal it &amp; gut protections for people with pre-existing conditions, I’ll fight it at every turn. https://t.co/jJNvVjydIhI voted this morning to deliver for Wisconsin. Taking on the fentanyl crisis, investing in our kids, growing our Made in Wisconsin economy, and so much more.

I’m proud to bring home wins for Wisconsin families. 
https://t.co/Kv1bXOGOP9Buying a home is more than just a place to live. It provides stability, builds strong communities, &amp; is part of the American dream. Sadly, it’s too expensive for many so I’m working to lower costs to put homeownership back in reach for more Wisconsinites.
https://t.co/b0vHxCUzOsBig inhaler companies are raking in billions of dollars while Wisconsinites are being forced to ration their inhalers just so they can afford them.

We took on these drug companies &amp; months later, they capped their inhalers at $35/month. This is the power of transparency. https://t.co/9l5bAbvyO1Happy #MarchMadness! I’m wishing good luck to all our Wisconsin basketball teams headed to the NCAA tournaments.🏀 #OnWisconsin #RiseWithUs #WeAreMarquette
https://t.co/ghpF9b6W6xWe launched an investigation into big drug companies jacking up inhaler costs.

Within weeks, three out of the four of them came clean and capped their costs at $35/month.

I will not stop fighting to lower health care costs and keep Wisconsinites healthy. https://t.co/oXKN3BHXzMUnfair trade practices by China in the shipbuilding industry jeopardize our national security &amp; undermine American jobs.

I’ll take on anyone to lower health care costs for Wisconsinites. https://t.co/8tkZpgAV4rWisconsinites who want to pursue a career in farming should be able to do so without being locked out because of the cost. 

I’m teaming up with @SenatorBraun to break down barriers to agricultural land ownership and make it easier for more Americans to enter the field. https://t.co/SruY84cxbHThe opioid epidemic isn’t a political issue.

That’s why I’m committed to working with everyone who wants to be a part of the solution to end this crisis and save Wisconsin lives. https://t.co/KyUqyR37k4Our farmers and producers are the engine that keeps our Wisconsin economy moving forward. This National Agriculture Week, I’m thanking the hardworking Wisconsinites who work day in and day out to feed our nation’s families. https://t.co/VNvwN5LMnEIf you’ve noticed grocery products getting smaller but the price remaining the same, it’s not you that’s crazy. It’s big corporations and their price-gouging tactics.

@SenBobCasey and I have a bill to change that. https://t.co/tsJV5L0c6kHappy National Agriculture Day!

I’m grateful for our Wisconsin farmers, producers, and ranchers who work hard to keep our agriculture economy moving forward and feed the world. Today and every day, I’m proud to support their critical work. https://t.co/b3bTYeccXHWisconsin makes things. We make the ships that defend our country and the engines that propel them. @FincantieriUS is part of that legacy, and it was great to have them in to discuss how I can support their work defending our country and the Wisconsin shipbuilding economy. https://t.co/PnAJ9E5F3kWisconsinites have been at the mercy of big drug companies jacking up the cost of their lifesaving inhalers and it’s just plain wrong. I'm proud of my work to hold these companies accountable for ripping off our families who rely on inhalers to breathe easier. https://t.co/Us74Wjyc4NToday, I heard firsthand from Milwaukee patients &amp; providers about how the high price of inhalers is impacting our families. Wisconsinites should not be ripped off to get these lifesaving devices &amp; I won’t stop fighting to hold big drug companies accountable. https://t.co/8d3opQjHgkWisconsin families deserve to be safe in their communities, and I’m proud to bring home the resources our law enforcement and public safety leaders need to keep our neighborhoods safe. https://t.co/oTxatLdPkG🚨News🚨 Glad to see yet another big drug company cap their inhaler prices to $35/month after I led an investigation into their price gouging tactics.

I’ll be in Milwaukee today to talk with Wisconsinites about how this will be a big win in lowering their health care costs.Women should have the freedom to control their bodies and health care — without having to travel across state lines.  

I am fighting for families, just like Megan’s, to make sure that they have the right to decide their futures.

https://t.co/cBNAtBStxWI hope everyone celebrating in Wisconsin and across the world has a happy and safe St. Patrick’s Day! 🍀I had a great discussion with Wisconsin law enforcement and public safety leaders who are committed to being part of the solution to ending the fentanyl epidemic. We can do this, but it will take all of us – working together. https://t.co/y07vAGZrNEIn case you missed it, the 6th Street corridor in Milwaukee is getting a makeover thanks to the funding I helped deliver! 

These improvements will reconnect communities that have been divided by past highway construction &amp; make it easier to access work, school, &amp; opportunity. https://t.co/tK3uE3r6qJCollaboration with government &amp; local leaders is key to tackling the fentanyl crisis. I joined Wisconsin law enforcement &amp; public safety leaders today in Milwaukee to discuss our work to fight this crisis &amp; keep Wisconsin safe. https://t.co/2AkBYE3buPProtecting Social Security &amp; Medicare, making the wealthy pay their fair share in taxes, and lowering prescription drug costs are all things I’m proud to be fighting for.Wisconsin’s shipbuilding industry has a strong history of supporting our economy and national security, but countries like China are rigging the system and hurting our workers. That’s why I’m fighting to bring shipbuilding back to America.
https://t.co/J4FcXsQxnpMy heart breaks for Nex’s loved ones &amp; the Owasso community. Nex, like too many LGBTQ+ kids, was bullied just for being their authentic selves.

Had a great meeting with @MKE_CC members to talk about our work to expand affordable housing and ensure law enforcement has the resources they need to keep our communities safe. https://t.co/l5BihhBxG6For too long, China has tried to rig the system with unfair trade practices that hurt American workers &amp; our national security.

https://t.co/ZpXabhMPGEI’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: No American should go broke just to get the medication they need to stay healthy.

My heart goes out to the loved ones of the nine lives tragically lost today. I am keeping their friends, families, and communities in my thoughts as we mourn this devastating loss.If we are investing taxpayer dollars, we better be using American workers, American materials, and American companies. I’m proud to have successfully pushed the President to ensure we do this when we rebuild our highways and bridges.From expanding civil rights to growing our Made in Wisconsin economy, some incredible women have shaped the Badger State. On International Women’s Day, I’m celebrating all the women who have made our state and country stronger! https://t.co/ih98xpkteLThe fentanyl epidemic doesn’t know county or party lines.

Well, we’ve noticed, and I’m saying no more of these deceiving tactics and price-gouging middle-class families. https://t.co/CTimbjTe5zThree weeks ago, Republicans killed a bipartisan compromise that would have helped secure our border, stop fentanyl from coming into the country, &amp; fixed parts of our broken immigration system — all because they'd rather play political games.

It's wrong &amp; I stand ready to act. https://t.co/FlfXiiDM6HWe had a simple bill to protect IVF &amp; families’ right to start a family on their own terms.

These price hikes aren’t a mystery to me. That’s why I’m working to pass legislation to increase transparency &amp; hold these big corporations accountable. https://t.co/Q9J7scn2bAWhen Roe v.

It’s wrong and I’m working to reign in these companies and lower costs for middle class families. https://t.co/vW4CKTGpuhExtremist Republicans have shown us time and time again that they will stop at nothing to strip women of their reproductive rights — including access to essential IVF services.

I trust women to control their own bodies, health care, and futures. RT if you do too.Across the state, we’re investing in the future of our local economies. Proud to have supported the Woodman's Sports &amp; Convention Center, &amp; it was great to join @GovEvers this week to break ground on a new chapter for Janesville.Two years ago, Putin launched a brutal war on Ukraine, leading to the needless death of thousands of Ukrainians, uprooting millions, &amp; scarring generations. Ukrainians have shown amazing resilience and resolve, &amp; I'm proud to stand with them in this fight for their future.You should have the right to abortion care.
 
You should have the right to IVF.
 
You should have the right to birth control.
 
This isn’t hard – you should have the right to control your body and future, not politicians, judges, or the government.Our farmers work day in and day out to feed our nation’s families and they shouldn’t have to face mental health challenges alone. I have a bill that would connect our farmers with the mental health care they need, and I won’t stop fighting to get it passed to save lives.In Wisconsin, our snowy winters aren’t just another season, but also a huge economic driver. As low snowfall continues to hit our businesses hard, I was happy to partner with @GovEvers to ensure Wisconsinites can get the support they need.

When this same illegal was arrested for harming a child, the sanctuary jurisdiction of NYC released him back on the streets instead of handing him over to ICE.This is a tragedy that could have been avoided. It is a failure at every level of government. Biden repealed all of Trump’s executive actions that secured the border, and has mass released illegals (including potentially this suspect) instead of detaining and deporting them. Sanctuary cities like NYC arrest criminal illegals and then release them back instead of handing them over to ICE to be deported. How many more innocent people need to die? How many more cities need to be overrun until politicians admit their soft on crime policies have been an abject failure?During Biden’s first 100 days in office, he took 94 executive actions to weaken our border security.

After reviewing the bill text, there are provisions that are highly problematic, especially considering the fact that President Biden and Secretary Mayorkas caused this border crisis and have refused to use existing laws already on the books to address it. It is hard to trust that the Biden Administration would even implement this bill in good faith.

Senator Lankford is leading a strong effort to force the Biden Administration to finally take steps to secure the border and stop the historically disastrous influx of illegal immigrants. Folks should take a deep breath: negotiations are ongoing and “leaks” about what is in the deal don’t reflect what is actually on the table. Republicans will only agree to a deal that stops abuse of our asylum system and stops the Biden Admin’s blatant abuse of parole, which it has used to mass release illegals.

Putin’s cruelty knows no bounds.Here’s the deal: we’re going to need nuclear power to meet our energy targets, so we need to get ready to invest in safe domestic nuclear production. I was glad to sit down with folks at Framatome in Lynchburg to discuss the future of nuclear fuel, regulation, and financing. https://t.co/Xk5tdGFY2jGreat discussion in Lynchburg with health care providers, law enforcement, and community members about an extremely pressing issue — the fentanyl crisis.

Now, it’s time to focus on keeping our promises to partners abroad and renewing our aid to Ukraine.Today marks the 14th anniversary of the Affordable Care Act. While most Republicans have finally conceded that the ACA saves lives and saves Americans money, the far-right has not stopped trying to repeal it.

Our message remains: we’ll never give up protecting this landmark law.Happy birthday to the ACA! For fourteen years, this seismic law has been lowering costs for Americans and covering millions for the first time. 
 
I’m proud to have voted for it, and I never get tired of hearing how it has helped Virginians.I’m extremely relieved to get government funding done and to secure millions for Virginia projects while we’re at it!
 
But the protracted procrastination made us look weak on the global stage and risked livelihoods. It never had to be this way.Shutdowns — even partial ones — are as devastating as they are stupid. The House passed a bipartisan spending bill to avoid a shutdown. Now it’s time for the Senate to pass it, too. This really shouldn’t be difficult!Busy week for Virginia: meeting with @VDEM leadership about the wildfires; introducing criminal justice, housing affordability, and animal abuse bills; and gearing up to pass government funding. Let’s get it across the finish line!Owning your own home is an enormous part of reaching the middle class, but for too long, the racial wealth gap has held Black families back from achieving that.

I want to see us pursue a range of policies to help first-gen buyers achieve the American Dream of homeownership.If you can’t understand that walking away from Ukraine now would give a huge green light to Putin and other authoritarian leaders around the globe, you really ought not to be shaping foreign policy.

Let’s renew the aid.Government shutdowns hurt hardworking civil servants and servicemembers. They disrupt lives and livelihoods.

Let’s do whatever we can to avert one this week.Glad to meet with @VDEM Chief of Staff Dillon Taylor and his team today to hear an update on the wildfires across Virginia and a range of other emergency management priorities.

Every country’s economy was hurt by COVID, but we’ve come out of it with record low unemployment because Democrats passed strategic investments in bringing manufacturing back home to America.We don’t even have a firm grasp yet on how generative AI and other tools could undermine security and trust in our elections. We must get serious about combatting these threats before November – too much is at stake.There’s still a proposal on the table to expand the Child Tax Credit, immediately lifting hundreds of thousands of kids out of poverty.

It’s a no-brainer. We should get it done.This week marks 14 years of the Affordable Care Act! For over a decade, the ACA has saved lives and cut costs for Americans. I’m proud to have supported it and thrilled to see Republicans finally accept how broadly popular it is and largely abandon their attempts to overturn it!To all my fellow Virginians who are celebrating Nowruz, I wish you a wonderful time spent gathering with friends and family. Nowruz means new day and thus represents reflection, rebirth and the hope for the good year ahead.

Standing down now would be cowardly, it would empower Putin, and it would give a green light to authoritarian leaders across the globe.

With so much at stake, why would we walk away now?DCA is already overcrowded, causing some of the worst delays in the US, yet out-of-region lawmakers are still trying to cram in more flights. I’m standing up to this ploy because it endangers the safety of the flying public and inconveniences Virginians.An election is hardly free and fair when your political rival just died in prison, and others remain unjustly detained. I join with Russians and others globally in continuing to mourn Alexei Navalny’s death and hoping for legitimate democracy in Russia.From abused beagles to show horses, I’ll always give a voice to the voiceless and stand up against animal abuse wherever it proliferates.

I’m proud to reintroduce legislation to crack down on the horrific practice of horse soring alongside @MikeCrapo.Read more here: https://t.co/Yek17XrqbuHomeownership is one of the surest paths to the middle class – but it’s often extremely hard to access for first-gen buyers.

Let’s get real spending bills done before Friday so we stop wasting time and money on this endless procrastination.We’ve officially confirmed 185 federal judges under the current administration.

I’m proud that one of them, Jasmine Yoon, will serve on the Western District of Virginia, and becomes the first person of color to do so.This morning, the Supreme Court is hearing a case that could have dramatic consequences for how we allow the government and Big Tech to communicate about threats and misinfo online. Continued communication is essential, so I’m closely watching the outcome of this historic case.Prices are coming down, stocks are staying high, and unemployment is still at historic lows.
 
Every country’s economy was rocked by COVID, but we’ve steadied the ship and come out stronger by building an economic recovery that focuses on growing the middle class.I’m disappointed the House still hasn't passed aid to Ukraine.

We look weaker and less trustworthy with every week we delay on getting this done. House Republicans should be jumping at the chance to carry on Reagan’s legacy by countering Russian authoritarianism.Virginia has already secured over $148 million for targeted projects across the Commonwealth for things like new affordable housing developments and domestic violence shelters. We have a chance to get even more in our next set of spending bills… let’s pass them ASAP!Great to meet with students from John R. Lewis High School!

The future of Europe is at risk here. Putin’s ambitions will only grow if he isn’t stopped now. The House needs to get it together and act.It’s always a pleasure to meet with Virginia’s brilliant Deltas (and my good friend @SenTimKaine)!

It’s time to get serious about passing something to keep Americans safe from our adversaries and forcing their sale.Huge news for Virginia – we have millions in federal funding headed to specific, high-impact projects across the Commonwealth. These are just some of the projects we’ve passed so far… and I want to get more done! https://t.co/5BoGGzR5AKThis week, @ODNIgov released their annual threat assessment, which draws clear attention to how weakened Russia is and how much they fear continued U.S. aid to Ukraine.

We cannot play right into their hands. We must renew the aid.Murthy v. Missouri might be the most impactful Supreme Court case you haven’t heard of yet… so I joined @amprog to discuss how this case could have HUGE ramifications for the future of communication between the government and Big Tech.My statement with @SenMarcoRubio on House passage of the legislation to protect Americans from foreign adversary controlled apps. https://t.co/2tI0q1hCuRI need to keep sounding the alarm because the ramifications are real and terrifying: I truly believe we are less prepared for threats to our election security than we were four years ago.

We need to meet the moment and get ahead of the range of threats we’re likely to see.NEW: I’m leading the Virginia delegation in a bipartisan push to bring tens of millions in federal investments to the Commonwealth to create jobs and onshore pharmaceutical manufacturing.

https://t.co/zsyzFfHZnOI’m thrilled we got Jasmine Yoon confirmed for the federal bench for the Western District of Virginia. She’s highly qualified, and she’s making the judiciary look more like the face of America as she becomes the first ever Asian American federal judge for Virginia!Yesterday, I hosted our annual Worldwide Threats hearing so leaders from across the Intelligence Community could communicate openly about the next generation of threats. It’s critical we have accountability &amp; transparency from the IC as we face an increasing array of challenges. https://t.co/6FuTOgM3L0Breathing a small sigh of relief after we got half the government funded.

Mifepristone is a safe, effective, and FDA-approved medication. Right-wing extremists want to ban access everywhere–even in states like New Mexico where abortion is legal.Authoritarian rule did not make Russians safer. It’s a good lesson for the 2024 election.

I’m about to go live on @CNN with @kaitlancollins to talk about border security and the GOP shutdown.To all my Republican colleagues saying they support IVF: prove it.In the last Congress, our Senate majority was so slim, we had to have the Vice President break the tie on vote after vote after vote (thanks again, @VP!).

But we did some really big bipartisan things, too. We had our differences, but the majority of us used to be here to govern.The Senate passed the bipartisan FEND Off Fentanyl Act because in order to fight the opioid epidemic, we need to cut fentanyl off at its source. If House Republicans are as serious as they claim to be about saving lives, they’ll pass it immediately.The Alabama Supreme Court’s ruling last week shows us that overturning Roe has consequences far beyond abortion access.

The GOP has no right to make health care decisions for women–including when or how they start a family.One week away from a partial government shutdown–one that will hurt families and our economy. Whether it’s the debt ceiling or a government shutdown, brinkmanship has been the only way House Republicans have governed the entire year they’ve held the majority.Isn’t that why you tapped so many self-funding, multi-millionaire candidates? https://t.co/WfhSmBF8Lwhttps://t.co/DhGOQNiR1pOur student loan debt crisis is one of the most limiting factors on our economy.

MAGA Republicans think we should deny everyone, whether they’re fleeing violence or just seeking to build a better life the way so many of our parents and grandparents did. We can't let extremists dictate policy.For two years, Democrats held the narrowest of majorities in the House and Senate and yet, we were the most productive Congress since the New Deal.

We actually cared about governing, though.As it so happens, I had some things to say about Republicans’ bogus claims that they want to secure the border when all they really want are political talking points and fodder for Trump campaign rallies.

Why do Republicans oppose border security?

Because they'd rather have a political issue than a solution.Officially filed to be on the ballot! ✅🗳

Thanks to the thousands of New Mexicans who signed my petition and to all those who volunteered to help collect signatures! We’re all in for New Mexico.Republicans are killing a border deal that would have cracked down on fentanyl and fentanyl precursors.

A future that improves lives, guarantees the right to IVF nationwide, restores Roe v. Wade and keeps our communities safe.So let me get this straight—@SenKatieBritt believes life begins at conception, which means she thinks embryos are children...

The law merely provides them immunity to do so.That’s a far cry away from the justice and reproductive freedom all families deserve.

Republicans created this health crisis in the first place by campaigning for decades to overturn Roe v.

#BringThemHomeNow 🎗️When @OMalleySSA visits Florida today, he needs to explain how he plans to address the Biden administration’s failure to fix looming insolvency issues within the Social Security Trust Fund that threaten future benefits.

I’ve introduced my Protect Our Seniors Act to do just that. What are Biden’s solutions?On #GoldStarSpousesDay, we honor the loved ones of those who made the ultimate sacrifice in service to our country. 

America is forever grateful for your incredible sacrifice in defense of our freedoms. https://t.co/QJwHa3lAOOThe same elite schools that want American taxpayers to pay off their graduates' massive student loans are allowing pro-terrorism, anti-Semitic demonstrations and threats against Jewish students. It's disgusting! 

Iran-backed Hamas terrorists murdered 1,200+ innocent people, beheaded babies, raped women and little girls, and are holding 100+ hostage, including Americans, for 182 days. @Columbia University must do better.Protecting aid workers and ALL civilians is important, but that includes the innocent civilians and Americans who were murdered or have been held hostage by Hamas for 181 days. 

No ceasefire should ever be on the table until all hostages are released and Hamas is destroyed.Floridians shouldn't be at risk because of Biden's open border policies.

We need to end this and secure the border NOW.
https://t.co/P4Yhev3EKM181 days have passed since families were torn apart & livelihoods destroyed by Iran-backed Hamas terrorists. These monsters didn’t care if it was a man, woman or child. They abused, murdered and took hundreds of them, including Americans. 

We cannot stop calling for their release & fighting to #BringThemHome NOW.When you do business in Communist China, the CCP controls everything—including when you’re allowed to leave the country and how you can operate. 

That’s not a good deal; it’s exposing your company to the will of our adversaries, and it must stop.We cannot allow @SenateDems to weaponize the @FTC and fuel their war on U.S. energy with misleading and false allegations.

In the wake of disaster recovery &amp; skyrocketing inflation, families need relief, not higher costs. https://t.co/ntTWpwCOIqEl presidente Biden y su administración fueron engañados por el dictador Nicolás Maduro y sus matones. Es absolutamente ridículo que el presidente de los Estados Unidos cayera en brazos de un dictador asesino despiadado e hiciera exactamente lo que quería. Al final del día, Maduro no cumplió su promesa de honrar la candidatura legítima de @MariaCorinaYA y celebrar elecciones libres y justas este año en Venezuela. Ahora Biden debe cumplir su palabra y volver a imponer sanciones al régimen asesino de Maduro. Maduro trabaja con Irán, Rusia, grupos terroristas extremistas del Medio Oriente, la China comunista y Cuba. Todos los regímenes malvados que odian a Estados Unidos. Él, al igual que sus compañeros en esos países, es un tirano genocida y un mentiroso y, sin embargo, Biden decidió confiar en él. Levantar las sanciones estadounidenses y permitir que el dinero fluya hacia Venezuela porque se cuenta con la palabra de un dictador loco es una de las cosas más ridículas que podría haber imaginado de este presidente. El Presidente Biden le falló al pueblo estadounidense y al pueblo venezolano. Es hora de que él y su administración reconozcan su fracaso y vuelvan a imponer sanciones a Nicolás Maduro. Joe Biden ha sido un desastre para la lucha por la libertad y la democracia en Venezuela, pero continuaremos trabajando junto al pueblo venezolano para devolver la democracia a su país.President Biden and his administration got played by Dictator Nicolás Maduro and his thugs. It is absolutely pathetic that the president of the United States ran into the arms of a ruthless, murdering dictator and did exactly what they wanted. At the end of the day, Maduro failed to keep his promise to honor the legitimate candidacy of @MariaCorinaYA and hold a free and fair election this year in Venezuela. Now Biden must honor his word and reimpose sanctions on the murderous Maduro regime. Maduro works with Iran, Russia, Middle East extremist terror groups, Communist China and Cuba. All evil regimes that hate America. He, just like his comrades in those countries, is a genocidal tyrant and a liar and yet Biden decided to trust him. Lifting U.S. sanctions and allowing money to flow into Venezuela because you’re counting on the word of a mad dictator is one of the most ridiculous things I could have imagined from this president. President Biden failed the American people and the Venezuelan people. It’s time for him and his administration to acknowledge their failure and immediately reimpose sanctions on Nicolás Maduro. Joe Biden has been a disaster for the fight for freedom and democracy in Venezuela, but we will continue working alongside the freedom-loving Venezuelan people to bring democracy back to their country.Read more ⬇️

https://t.co/mi6pcKROZDThese videos are just a glimpse of the unimaginable violence Iran-backed Hamas terrorists inflicted on innocent people 179 days ago.

What you don’t see are the faces these cars belong to, the individuals who were murdered or taken hostage by these monsters, some of them American citizens. @POTUS, demand their release now!Dictators, terrorists and thugs stick together…

This is why we need real leadership in the White House. Biden’s weak appeasement policies aren’t working, and it’s creating chaos at home and abroad.Biden’s bad economic policies are stretching Florida families’ budgets to the max, forcing them to tap into savings or rack up debt to make ends meet.
 
It doesn’t have to be this way! We MUST stop the spending spree and get our fiscal house in order. It’s what Floridians, and every American, deserves.When I met with leaders in Israel, I heard about @IDF’s incredible work to destroy Hamas & bring every hostage home while doing everything possible to protect civilians in Gaza. 

While Hamas uses everyone in Gaza, even children, as human shields, the IDF is working to protect them even as it fights Hamas terrorism.RT @Israel: Since the beginning of the war, 369,990 tons of aid have been transferred to Gaza.

Our adversaries are emboldened, and our communities are less safe. When will this admin wake up? It’s time to take a stand and secure our border before it’s too late!Unacceptable. I will not allow Biden to put Floridians in danger by flying unvetted illegal aliens into our state.

BUT she recalls writing the 9/6/2016 joint statement which emboldened and supported DAPL protesters…Really??
https://t.co/RyBKLNOvmjLater, Darcy said it would be an “unfortunate outcome” if North Dakota was left to foot the bill.

#HappyAgWeek to Nebraska’s leading industry!Manufacturing EVs emits 60% more carbon than gas vehicles, and studies have shown electric cars heighten overall emissions compared to hybrid cars.

The EPA’s new tailpipe emissions rule is political, not environmental.Precision ag innovations allow producers to be more efficient, but high costs and lack of connectivity create major barriers to entry. 

My Precision Ag Package helps producers adopt this technology.

I will continue my efforts to make these solutions a part of the Farm Bill. https://t.co/DomznUuRmWBiden’s EV pipedreams are creating nightmares for America’s trucking industry.

The EPA’s recent regulations to electrify U.S. trucking fleets could cost taxpayers nearly $1 trillion.

It’s time for the admin to put American’s best interests before its radical climate agenda.1 in 4 jobs in the state of Nebraska are tied to the agricultural industry.

Proud to celebrate the industry that drives our state’s economy during #NationalAgWeek!The administration should come clean about the dirty truth behind electric vehicles, including the EV record on environmental problems, safety risks, and human rights abuses.

Read my op-ed:

https://t.co/1JouLqKsgnMandating electric vehicles only exacerbates their serious environmental, safety, and human rights concerns.
 
The EPA should take its hands off the wheel and allow the market to work its course.This admin is spearheading a reckless push toward an electric future with a host of negative consequences.

Today's tailpipe emissions rule neglects environmental, safety, and performance issues in favor of political posturing.Today’s tailpipe emissions rule slows the original timeline for forcing EVs on America. EPA's responding to reality: Americans don’t want them.

Ford, General Motors, Mercedes, Volkswagen — they're all scaling back on EVs. EPA must follow &amp; hit the brakes on its climate charade.California insists it's “speculative” to assume EVs will remain heavier than gas cars.
 
Public policy should reflect reality, not the baseless future dream of featherweight electric cars.

What’s speculative, obviously, is assuming with no evidence that their weight will change. https://t.co/n8DtWDMEtXThe truth is that EVs aren’t a magic bullet for the environment.
 
They’re underdeveloped and pose safety risks.
 
And they create more problems than they solve, both at home and abroad. https://t.co/aVVvB1qTpgThe way the administration and their activist friends paint EVs, you’d think these cars are a time-tested environmental blessing.
 
But behind the curtain of this climate crusade, there’s a host of problems — problems the admin has tried to hide. https://t.co/iM2Ks1KD0cWishing both @gocreighton and @Huskers men and women’s basketball teams good luck in the NCAA March Madness Tournament!Every day, support for Paid Family and Medical Leave continues to grow.

Now, Congress needs to act.

My PFML tax credit is the only policy with a track record of passage in Congress, and it will deliver meaningful relief for families and caregivers.
https://t.co/i3E6gkJQ6dThe Biden administration’s revised standard responds to a slowdown in sales as Americans realize not just the cost and unreliability of electric vehicles, but also the dirty truth behind this supposedly ‘clean’ technology.Continuing to force EVs on automakers and the public will only exacerbate their serious environmental, safety, and human rights concerns. Instead of delaying these standards, @POTUS  should abandon this attempt to appease climate activists and allow the market to take its course.More practical, market-driven changes—like allowing the year-round sale of E15 ethanol—would help achieve environmental goals for America’s vehicle fleet.

The REEF Act will right the wrong of unfair cuts, ensuring that the people who keep our trains moving receive the benefits they’ve earned.
https://t.co/bKbUnDTomU https://t.co/g3okVzmzSq.@NTIAgov's plan follows a pattern of ignoring serious concerns from the Department of Defense about management of our federal airwaves. These spectrum airwaves are vital to highly sensitive and unique defense systems that keep Americans safe.You simply cannot slap a price tag on relocating them. In many cases, the costs are astronomical, or the systems cannot be re-engineered to function effectively in different bands of spectrum.If NTIA continues to move forward on its current course, mission-critical defense operations will be at risk and taxpayer dollars will be wasted.

NTIA is at a pivotal moment and must consider our nation's spectrum needs more holistically.
https://t.co/mQR98cE7nxI am disappointed and deeply concerned that USPS is moving forward with plans to downgrade the North Platte Post Office. Transferring some operations to Denver risks cutting jobs and increasing delivery delays for Nebraskans.It is also especially difficult to understand how sending intra-Nebraska mail out of state would improve efficiency. The best decisions impacting our communities are made by the people who live and work there, not government bureaucrats.I will continue to fight against this misguided decision.

I strongly encourage North Platte citizens to make their views and voices heard on this important topic.
https://t.co/zi5W3cJHYjThis package includes several top priorities for our state — including funding towards the construction of a new Agricultural Research Service facility at UNL, an expansion of the Heartland Expressway, and increased funding for Offutt Air Force Base and for airports across NE.The investments we make today will ensure that Nebraska is well positioned to seize the opportunities ahead. As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I will continue to push for the critical, high-impact investments that will support families and business across our state.https://t.co/YPGVWK4icGTonight, President Biden painted an imaginary picture of America: an America where families’ high grocery bills are the fault of businesses instead of inflation, and where the dreams of wealthy climate activists matter more than the reality facing working Americans.But in addition to a struggling economy, today’s America faces historic illegal immigration at home and rising threats abroad. It’s far from the one in the president’s imagination, and we can’t afford to fund his dreams any longer.California and the EPA are burying evidence. 

Studies have shown that heavy EVs emit more tire wear pollution than gas-powered cars, but climate activists are ignoring the numbers that don’t prop up their political platform.

https://t.co/opS5yuxj2VOf course there’s credible evidence that Hamas raped and tortured — it’s about time the UN confirmed it.

No one can question Israel’s right to end Hamas terrorists forever.
https://t.co/OYN8PNHmHTEV mandates harm the economy and Americans. But what California won't tell us is that they harm the environment too.

The truth is that heavy EVs emit more particulate pollution than gas-powered cars.
https://t.co/vVM1YSpnH8Omaha police are on high alert because of a “large increase” in illicit drugs trafficked by Mexican cartels — 1,500 miles away from the southern border.

https://t.co/fIuJiOmwGpThe UN confirmed what we’ve known all along: Hamas raped and tortured innocent Israelis on Oct. 7.

Every human rights organization — especially UN Women — should have denounced this onslaught immediately.
https://t.co/OYN8PNHmHTIt's concerning that @EPA would propose regulations that will arbitrarily close plants and eliminate rural jobs.

This week, I led a letter urging @EPAMichaelRegan to withdraw EPA's proposed rule on wastewater discharge from meat &amp; poultry processors.
https://t.co/eQOadZJAJ5I am excited to support John Barrasso for Whip. I know John well. He is a principled problem solver with the expertise and skills needed to advance our values and move bills. 

He is a unifying figure in our conference who can serve as the right messenger to the American people.California wants to hide the truth about EVs: they emit more particulate pollution than gas-powered cars.

The Biden admin and its allies must consider the science rather than mandating EV use for political points.
https://t.co/vVM1YSpnH8The more science we learn, the clearer it is that Democrats haven't done their homework before pushing EV mandates that hurt families, workers, &amp; businesses. 

No wonder workers are abandoning Democrats. The push for EVs is based on politics, not science. 
https://t.co/JadykpsGhAIgnoring border patrol agents is a mistake. Neglecting the border crisis is a disaster. Failing to secure our nation is an abdication of duty.Americans can celebrate that the Supreme Court has rejected this authoritarian effort that would interfere in our elections and block Donald Trump from even standing for office.This ruling is a victory for our democracy and a resounding defeat for those who would abuse our Constitution for short-term political gain.Abandoning or downsizing Sentinel isn’t an option.

Despite many, many Republican efforts to repeal it, the law still stands—and it's more popular than ever.

I'll always work to build on this landmark legislation and lower health care costs for Virginians.Just so you know...we negotiated a bipartisan tax bill that includes the expanded child tax credit—a tax cut for middle class families. It'd be a huge relief for so many.

Senate Republicans are threatening to filibuster it.We must move quickly to fund the government and avoid a needless shutdown that'd be devastating for Virginians. https://t.co/vVHsRxb8uKI don't know how many times Trump has to say he wants to ban abortion nationwide and rip away women's reproductive rights before people start taking him seriously.

...do you hear what the leader of your party is saying? Take it up with him.The expanded Child Tax Credit—a middle class tax cut that nearly slashed child poverty in half—was a game-changer for so many Virginia families.

It's past time we renew it.Four years ago today was when the COVID-19 pandemic became real for so many people.

Folks were stockpiling toilet paper, the economy was in free fall, and we had a President who wasn’t interested in keeping people safe.

What a remarkable comeback we’ve made.3 years ago today, @JoeBiden signed the American Rescue Plan into law. It was the critical piece of legislation that helped us kickstart the great American comeback—the best economic recovery in the world.

This November, let's reelect them and build on this historic progress. #SOTUReminder: the only reason Congress hasn't passed a comprehensive, bipartisan border security bill is because Donald Trump told Republicans not to support it—and they cowered to him instead of voting with Democrats to pass it. #SOTUThe child care crisis is holding too many Virginians back. @JoeBiden is right—we must do more to help families find and afford quality child care. #SOTUOur friends in Ukraine are counting on us to deliver aid and help them fight back against Putin's war of aggression. It's time for Speaker Johnson to get this passed in the House. The longer we wait, the longer this war drags out. #SOTUCongratulations to Sweden on officially joining NATO—a historic moment of strength for this critical alliance.

Can you chip in whatever you can right now to help us win this November? https://t.co/RnkUAEcn8SSenate Democrats tried (again) to pass a bill to protect access to IVF.

Republicans blocked it (again).

They spent all week pretending like they want to protect IVF.

Today’s vote shows it was all a charade.I’m sponsoring legislation to protect IVF access for women across the country.

Women—not politicians—should have full control to decide if, when, and how they want to start a family.

We can’t let MAGA Republicans succeed in banning reproductive health care like IVF.Democrats have been sounding the alarm about threats to IVF for years.

We even tried to pass a bill to protect IVF back in 2022. Senate Republicans blocked it.

Republicans may say they want to protect IVF, but their actions show otherwise.We're just days away from a partial government shutdown—one that can be completely avoided if House Republicans just get their act together and stop playing political games.

We shouldn't have to go through this same dance every few months because House Republicans can't govern.Best way to start off my birthday? Voting early for @JoeBiden in Richmond this morning alongside my friend @JennMcClellanVA!

But House GOP are pushing bogus bills to double down on giveaways to Big Oil and kill good-paying clean jobsJudge shopping was exactly what led to the terrible case in the Northern District of Texas, where anti-choice extremists handpicked a MAGA judge to revoke FDA approval of mifepristone nationwide

Courts must apply the Judicial Conference’s new reforms to limit judge shopping nowThe @RepublicanStudy budget is the GOP agenda:

Cutting Social Security
Repealing $35 insulin for seniors on Medicare
Repealing Medicare’s authority to negotiate cheaper prescription prices
Giving trillions of dollars in tax breaks for the ultra-wealthy
Cutting the ACAThe @RepublicanStudy new budget plan in two words: Dangerous. Disastrous.

Dangerous because it doubles down on the hard-right’s war on women.

Disastrous because it proposes draconian cuts to Social Security while raising the retirement age.

But that’s the House GOP agenda.With this funding package we are working for:

We are strengthening border security.

We are protecting our elections.

We are avoiding the draconian cuts and poison pills that MAGA extremists wanted.This funding package will go a long way to:

Strengthening our economy
Safeguarding our national security
Increasing funding for childcare
Boosting disease research and prevention
Funding school mental health programs and suicide preventions

We'll keep working to get this done.As we approach 14 years since the Affordable Care Act was signed into law, here’s the difference:

Watch LIVE on Fox News!Senator @JDVance1: “What you might expect happened in a good faith negotiation that was actually about the border, if we were actually trying to secure the border, you might have said this is not the Democrats’ best offer, let’s go back to the negotiating table, let’s continue to push for border security, because that is the most pressing crisis that we face as a country.

“And what happened instead is after an hour, Senate Democrats and even some in Republican leadership decided that we should move on from border security. They had checked the box, now let’s move on to their real priority, which is sending another $61 billion to Ukraine. It stinks to high heaven, ladies and gentlemen. No one who watched this process unfold believes that Republican leadership negotiated in good faith for border security or that Democrats did the same.

“It was always kabuki theater. It was always an excuse to say ‘we tried on the border, now let’s move on to the thing that really matters, which is the money for Ukraine.’ And that failure, the way that it blew up in the faces of our leadership and the appearance gave lie to the idea that this was ever really about border security.

“And by the way, it alienated millions of Republican and independent voters who want their government to focus on the most pressing problem for this country, and that is the border.

It can play a vital role in enforcing a demilitarized zone at the border with Israel &amp; stabilize Lebanon’s democracy &amp; economy.On my visit to Jordan, a pivotal takeaway is that they will be critical in negotiations for peace &amp; stability in the region—including facilitating a pause in the war, humanitarian relief, &amp; hostage return—&amp; longer term, self governance for Palestinians in a two state solution.King Abdullah is key. In our conversation, he was emphatic on how monumental this moment is, &amp; we must seize it. A pause before Ramadan, is potentially within reach.

Now, I’m glad to see our state lawmakers and leaders making progress to take back our streets from criminals.

Proud to co-lead this important effort with @SenLaphonza in the Senate. https://t.co/CxtqoSFDkLI hear regularly from Georgians who are struggling to afford the cost of their medications, especially insulin.

Insulin is a lifesaving drug that millions of Georgians and Americans need to survive.

I won’t stop fighting until the cost is capped at $35 for *everyone*.More than half a million Georgians have lost their Medicaid health care coverage, most through no fault of their own. What a terrible mess.

We could help address this if our state leaders would simply expand Medicaid and close Georgia’s health care coverage gap.After months of hard work, I’m thrilled to announce that I was able to secure over *$227 million* in federal funding for important projects all across the Peach State!

According to @TheChartisGroup, “facilities in states that have not expanded Medicaid have consistently performed worse financially than their expansion state counterparts.”

Another reason Georgia should expand Medicaid.After Georgia saw record voter turnout that helped change the political direction of the country, state leaders enacted a restrictive suppression law. 

I wonder why. https://t.co/H9LFVcJ5QrI loved getting the chance to meet with young scholars in the Early College program at @valdostastate!

This move by @POTUS and his administration will help save lives while we keep pushing for a ceasefire, the release of all hostages, and a pathway to a lasting peace.Thank you for your commitment to protecting our democracy, @POTUS.

Congress should do its part by passing the Freedom to Vote Act &amp; the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act—two bills that would help ensure every eligible American can help set our country’s future. #SOTUBefore it went away, the expanded Child Tax Credit cut child poverty nearly in half.

Now there’s a bipartisan plan to revive it and put money *back* in working class parents' pockets.

Glad @POTUS understands the importance of renewing this vital tax cut for working families.I’ve pushed @POTUS to deliver meaningful student debt relief—and even with their hands tied, the Biden-Harris Administration has *still* CANCELLED more than $138 *BILLION* in student loan debt for more than 3.8 million Americans.

Proud of this progress—but we have to keep going.Georgians sent me &amp; @POTUS to Washington, and we capped insulin costs for seniors at $35/month. Now I’m leading a bipartisan push in the Senate to cap insulin costs at $35/month for everyone who needs it.

Glad to have the President on our side in this fight. Let’s get it done.There’s no replacement for American leadership in the world.

Standing with our allies like Ukraine is in America’s national security interests. #SOTUWhile it’s Congress that funds the federal government, I’m glad @POTUS’ proposed budget reflects his dedication to investing in priorities that are important for Georgia &amp; that I've long been fighting for—like expanding Medicaid to the 640K+ Georgians in the coverage gap. (1/2)Ultimately Congress must pass government funding legislation that invests in our families &amp; communities—and from pushing to cap insulin costs at $35/month for everybody to extending tax credits to first time homebuyers, &amp; more, I'm glad to have @POTUS on the frontlines. (2/2)Over 640,000 Georgians currently don’t have health care because they’ve fallen in the health care coverage gap. I brought one of those Georgians with me to the #SOTU tonight—Heather Payne, an ER travel nurse from Dalton. #SOTU2024 (1/5) https://t.co/fAx9Y5kaLRExpanding Medicaid in Georgia &amp; the nine other non-expansion states wouldn't just allow millions like Heather to get the coverage they need—it would also  save lives, keep hospitals open &amp; create jobs.

AND, Georgia would get a $1.2 billion signing bonus! #SOTU2024 (4/5)I was arrested in 2014 fighting to expand Medicaid, and it’s still a top priority for me in the Senate.

Washington can’t stop me from fighting to expand Medicaid for Georgians just like Heather &amp; millions of Americans in the health care gap. #SOTU2024 (5/5) https://t.co/6kzwn6K6MWHeather was a travel nurse from Dalton until she experienced a series of strokes. Already in the health care coverage gap, Heather can’t afford the care she needs.

The passage of the House TikTok ban is not just a misguided overreach; it's a draconian measure that stifles free expression, tramples constitutional rights, and disrupts the economic pursuits of millions of Americans.

With an iron fist, Congress dictated an unrealistic and narrow path for divestment, effectively banning TikTok and ignoring its substantial investments in data security.

This act is not securing our nation—it's a disturbing gift of unprecedented authority to President Biden and the Surveillance State that threatens the very core of American digital innovation and free expression.RT @WashTimes: Rand Paul rails against Trump’s endorsement of Mike Rogers for Michigan Senate seat

https://t.co/lULazkxxc3 https://t.co/Fm…🧵1/2

Reactionaries who want to ban TikTok claim the data can’t be secured because the “algorithm” is in China.  

Not true.  

The truth is the Algorithm runs in the U.S. in oracle cloud with their review of the code. (NOT in China). 

Maybe we should examine the facts before committing violations of the 1st and 5th amendments.🧵2/2

They want to ban TikTok because it’s “owned by China”

Not true. 

60% of the company is owned by US and international investors. 

20% is owned by the company founders. 

20% is owned by company employees, including over 7,000 Americans. 

The CEO of TikTok is from Singapore, not China.

President Biden treats the taxpayers as though we are limitless ATMs. Every dollar taken by the government from those who earned it is a dollar not spent on a family’s dinner table, a child’s education, or a retirement plan.

This budget is nothing more than the Democrat ideologue’s blueprint for an election-year gambit at the expense of Americans. We must demand fiscal responsibility and restore the sanctity of the American taxpayer's wallet.

Via @RNCResearch:

🚨 Biden’s budget includes $5.5 trillion in tax hikes — increasing from roughly 18 percent of GDP to 20+ percent — even after the IRS collected a record $4.9 trillion in tax revenue last fiscal year.
🚨 Biden proposes massive corporate tax increases, giving the U.S. a higher business tax rate than communist China.
🚨 Biden’s budget restores billions of dollars for a supercharged IRS, even after it was successfully clawed back by Republicans.
🚨 Biden proposes a second death tax by removing the step-up in basis upon certain inheritance.
🚨 Biden proposes homebuyer and mortgage tax credits — an admission that record mortgage rates and skyrocketing rents are unaffordable under Biden — that would make the housing crisis worse by doing nothing to address supply.
🚨 Biden wants billions to “train young workers” on climate change — a major tenant of AOC’s Green New Deal.

Hōkūle‘a carries the message that the ocean connects us all—these voyages are crucial to preserving and growing this once-lost part of Polynesian culture in Hawai‘i. https://t.co/6tbMKrH9Q8PVS has been reclaiming traditional wayfinding techniques and revitalizing Polynesian culture for more than five decades. I'm glad we're able to support them through this earmark.

It's unacceptable. Our laws needs to change.Stories like these are why @SenToddYoung and I introduced the Stop Child Labor Act, which establishes new criminal penalties &amp; max fines for employers who violate child labor laws.

Groceries cost more. Rent costs more. Gas costs more. Idahoans are tired of pinching pennies to make it by.

It’s beyond time to end the reckless spending.The president’s inflated $7.3 trillion budget proposal is chock-full of billions of dollars in unnecessary spending, including billions for the EPA to address a “climate crisis.” In simple terms, this budget would give the Biden administration funds to establish even more unrealistic and burdensome regulations for Idahoans to pay for.Even the left-leaning New York Times is acknowledging the burden Bidenflation has imposed on Americans. These “inflation-friendly recipes” are proof that the president and democrats’ spending habits are too much to bear.
https://t.co/mlpSX6I7f3Inflation is up 18.6% since President Biden took office. Yesterday, he unveiled a $7.3 trillion budget proposal with a $1.8 trillion deficit. Excess spending isn’t the answer to inflation, it’s the catalyst. Americans cannot afford Biden’s agenda.I will not vote for any bill that allows any illegals to cross into this country. My red line is not one illegal entrant. We need to enforce the laws we have. https://t.co/3FW7R31Hw1The President tried to pass the buck for rising food costs by blaming companies for “shrinkflation.” In reality, he’s trying to cover up that his anti-agriculture and business policies have led to the highest food price inflation in over 4 decades and shrinkflation is to blame for almost none of it.This spending package is disappointing—it comes more than five months into the fiscal year, is jammed full of earmarks and the left’s political priorities, and it fails to move towards reducing our national debt. This is not fiscal conservatism, and, as such, I cannot vote for it.President Biden doubled down on his radical green agenda last night. That means more regulations, more red tape, and more jobs lost. America could be energy independent, but the president would rather appease environmental extremists.International women’s day is about celebrating women around the globe for all they  do. The women serving on my staff and leading my family are some of the strongest, most talented women I know. I am proud to celebrate their achievements today and every day. https://t.co/RiG6ixUIIAPresident Biden claimed in his speech that his administration is keeping the family farm going, but his aggressive regulatory agenda is threatening the existence of Idaho’s farmers and ranchers.When the president talked about his Buy America bill, he conveniently forgot that his Secretary of the VA is allowing that very bill to be the reason veterans housing facilities across the country, including three in Idaho, won’t see the updates they need. 

https://t.co/XcCXxXNQ41China is seeking every opportunity to diminish American national security, and here is yet another example. 

China is America’s biggest threat. 

We must stop the CCP from harming us on our own soil.
 
https://t.co/HRAPOOeOShJoining Neal Larson and Julie Mason this morning on NewsTalk at 8:05am (mt). Tune in here: https://t.co/lhbY3qQuRk !America’s veterans have waited far too long for updated facilities in Idaho &amp; around the country. Due to @SecVetAffairs choosing to selectively apply requirements, veterans will wait longer, &amp; it will cost taxpayers more money for needed facility updates.
https://t.co/KtnPBYLD6S7,000 illegal immigrants a day is 7,000 too many.
https://t.co/ulKJGH8ttkThe Biden admin’s attack on Idaho law is more than jeopardizing the lives of future generations; it is also threatening the balance of power between federal and state governments.Loans are a pretty simple concept. The borrower agrees to pay back the full amount borrowed with interest. 

That isn’t President Biden’s definition however, and last night he bragged about his unfair student loan forgiveness scheme.I’ve fought every illegal forgiveness effort by the president because it is just wrong to force Idahoans to cover these costs. 

You borrow it, you pay it. 

It’s that simple.Immigration is one of the biggest issues facing America today, yet President Biden waited ~40 minutes to even touch it. 

Ridiculous.

But remember, President Biden has the same laws President Trump had to address the crisis.Trump enforced them. Biden doesn’t.

Trump eliminated a crisis and constantly reminds us of how to combat the crisis. Biden plays the blame game and waits to bring it up.In tonight’s #SOTU speech, President Biden doubled down on his open border policy and again tried to blame Congress.Biden’s predecessor, with the current law, reduced illegal immigration to zero with executive orders requiring the border patrol to enforce the laws. President Biden rescinded those orders, and the result is 10,000 illegal entrants invading our country every day.President Biden can reinstate President Trump’s orders and reduce the flow of illegal migrants to zero—if not, Trump will do so when he is elected. I will continue to fight for a zero number of illegals entering America.With President Biden's SOTU tonight, I'm preparing to hear a lot of falsities, exaggerations, and a big effort to play the blame game. 

I'm sure we'll hear about the economy, immigration, and guns. And, I am certain he'll spin the realities of those issues...Just to set the record straight:

- Liberal spending has worsened inflation & Idahoans pay more and more for goods today than they did when he took office.

- The border crisis is worse because of the president's open border policies and refusal to use his statutory powers to address it. 

- The Constitution protects our Second Amendment right, but the administration does not care. It is using every opportunity to diminish the rights of law-abiding gun owners.The ATF wants to hold federal firearm license dealers to impossible clerical standards to make it harder to legally sell and buy firearms. This is the latest in the Biden administration’s war on your constitutional rights.
https://t.co/fvz0o6ctJXHappy Idaho Day! On this day in 1863, President Abraham Lincoln created the Idaho Territory.

I’m glad to see Idaho’s own Tim Cornie reap the benefits of successful soil management.President Biden continues to hide from his border crisis by going to the crossing with the lowest illegal encounters.

This trip is proof he’s not able to face the magnitude of the crisis, which includes more than 9 million illegal migrant crossings during his time in office.

He can fix this, but he won’t.Idahoans believe in the right-to-life & the 10th Amendment.

Since President Biden took office, both of these principles have been under attack. His HHS wrongfully interpreted EMTALA to allow ER doctors to provide abortions. This blatantly contradicts EMTALA’s lifesaving purpose.I know it. Idaho knows it. America knows it.

The millions of immigrants entering the US illegally is the elephant in the room the president cannot keep ignoring.
https://t.co/udD4Vivq3nBiden needs a reality check on EMTALA.

EMTALA protects life. So does Idaho’s law.

The president is wrong. https://t.co/hFqxgio7f4Biden’s HHS is ignoring the fact there’s no federal right to an abortion, misrepresenting federal law, attacking state laws, and pushing for abortion on-demand.

To counteract this federal abuse of power, I submitted an amicus brief to SCOTUS.
https://t.co/xVFuarWqAVJulie Su’s track record, including the loss of billions of dollars in fraud and promotion of labor unions, has failed America’s workforce.

America needs a Labor Secretary who will strengthen U.S. jobs. Julie Su has proven she cannot and will not fight for our labor force.Since day one, President Biden has stripped hard-working Americans of good paying jobs for the sake of his radical green agenda. The president’s failure to invest in American energy is a threat to U.S. national security and economic stability.
https://t.co/WoqPg6Sd0qIt is time for America to see the power of the US mining industry, invest in it, &amp; secure our supply chain. To ensure not just economic success but also national security, Congress must revamp our mining laws &amp; substantially reduce irrelevant regulations.
https://t.co/ifxun6uVTbThe Biden admin is yet again forcing billions of dollars of student loan debt onto those who have already paid their debt or never took it on in the first place. Hardworking Americans now burdened by this “forgiveness” will never forgive President Biden.
https://t.co/4pOIdgZvByI’m glad to see Idaho legislators opposing the Biden admin’s open border policies – something I've been working on since he was inaugurated. Mr. President, open your eyes to reality. You have the authority, now do it. Secure the border.
https://t.co/ks1TEePo9RUnder President Biden’s three years in office, prices have risen 18% and spending has gotten out of hand.

It’s time for Washington to get back to the basics: rein in reckless spending and drive down our national debt.The future of Idaho agriculture is in good hands with FFA’s leadership and service. I am proud to celebrate the thousands of Idaho FFA members who work diligently to become the next generation of farmers, ranchers, and agricultural industry professionals. #NationalFFAWeek https://t.co/O1oJ6VP6MsIdahoans cannot wait 45 days for the FAA to grant emergency access to airspace when a wildfire is decimating our state.

@SecVetAffairs, issue the waiver and stop playing politics with our veterans.
https://t.co/eHskc2nYrAInflation is still squeezing Idahoans’ pocketbooks. The President and excessive spending from the far left is to blame.

They’ve driven prices up more than 17% in three years. This cannot continue—it’s unfair to every Idahoan.
https://t.co/eDtm8UpmehIt is appalling to witness the Biden administration, who has the ability to enforce our immigration laws, fail to secure the southern border and protect the American people.

On National Girls and Women in Sports Day, I’m proud to support the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act to preserve women’s opportunities to compete in sports on a safe and level playing field.One illegal crossing is one too many, yet this bill would allow thousands of illegal migrants a day into the U.S. That’s an insult to the American people who need and expect our laws to be enforced. To be very clear, it is a criminal and civil offense to enter America unlawfully. President Biden has the law, authority, and money behind him to stop this, but he won’t do it. To halt this chaos, we must enforce our laws, build the wall, and remove incentives to come here illegally.U.S. air quality standards are in place to protect public health, not for the Biden administration to unfairly attack western states and businesses in order to further its green agenda. 

This is unreasonable, unnecessary, and harmful.
https://t.co/1CBA3HuU5HThe financial burden breaching the lower Snake River dams would have on Idahoans would be staggering.

🔗https://t.co/JHG1jdFDFGThe Biden admin’s war on appliances just escalated.

🔗https://t.co/DQ42cggOKWThe Biden admin’s radical green agenda is limiting and delaying significant energy projects across the U.S. Its ban of U.S. LNG exports is just the latest move to endanger national security interests and impede any progress toward American energy independence.Freedom of religion is foundational to our country, and I am fiercely opposed to any efforts that would degrade or impair that right for all Americans.

Biden's border policies are failing. We need sound border security policies to stop encouraging migrants to illegally enter the United States. https://t.co/KN0MixM5HCWATCH NOW: Speaking on the Senate floor regarding the crisis at the southern border.

Our adversaries must not doubt that perpetrating violence will be met with a response.This week I met with Comptroller General Gene Dodaro from @USGAO to discuss the on-going investigation into the mismanagement of the Veterans Crisis Line (VCL) which I initiated after whistleblowers contacted my office with concerns for the health &amp; safety of veterans nationwide.GAO is investigating the issues at VCL in a serious manner to facilitate improvements and address deficiencies. I will continue to monitor this investigation and appreciate Comptroller General Dodaro’s dedication to improving the lives of veterans across the country.Today, I spoke with National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Chair Jennifer Homendy regarding the Alaska Airlines investigation and she assured me NTSB is working diligently to discover the problem and resolve the issue.I am closely monitoring this investigation to ensure the safety of the flying public.

82,ChrisVanHollen,"Today we joined @POTUS in Baltimore with a clear message: we will move heaven and earth to clear the channel, open the Port and rebuild the bridge ASAP.

And we will continue to support the families of the 6 individuals we lost, and all our first responders and recovery crews. https://t.co/wMqk6slolKWith 303K new jobs added last month, our economy continues to grow and defy expectations under @POTUS. We’ve also seen unemployment stay below 4% for more than two full years.

We’re investing in the ingenuity of the American people — and it’s paying dividends every single day.This is big news. Thanks to tireless work from @USACEHQ and state &amp; local partners, a temporary channel is expected to open as soon as the end of this month &amp; the main channel by end of May.

Their quick work is vital for thousands of workers &amp; families in Baltimore &amp; across MD.Glad to see this new rule from @POTUS which, as we learned in the Trump era, is badly needed to protect our merit-based civil service and prevent the federal government from becoming a cesspool of political cronyism. https://t.co/DetFEK04mfIn the week since this horrific tragedy, we've marshaled every federal, state &amp; local resource at our disposal to clear debris so we can reopen the Port &amp; rebuild.

We've also come together to support the families of the 6 individuals we lost &amp; all those impacted by this tragedy. https://t.co/aqDdcqUo1aThese workers were trying to feed starving people.

The challenge of getting assistance into Gaza is already overwhelming — aid workers from @WCKitchen @UN &amp; others shouldn't face death when distributing it. ENOUGH!

My heart goes out to @chefjoseandres and the @WCKitchen team.The Dobbs decision stripped away reproductive rights of millions of women. It’s also created an unconscionable &amp; unsustainable reality for doctors &amp; their patients.

Recently, Dr. Zahedi-Spung provided gut-wrenching testimony about this appalling situation in the wake of Dobbs: https://t.co/OSlA9SkB6NFact: More than 80% of House Republicans signed onto a plan that endorses a national abortion ban and puts access to IVF on the chopping block. Their radical agenda is out of step with the American people — and we will stop it in the U.S. Senate.Partnership shouldn’t be a 1-way street.

@POTUS told Netanyahu there are ""no excuses"" for restricting aid—but food still isn’t getting to starving ppl in Gaza

He called invading Rafah a ""red line”—but Netanyahu says he’ll do it anyway

So now we send more bombs to Netanyahu? ⬇️ https://t.co/AF4JArpUhVToday I met with longshoremen impacted by the Key Bridge tragedy &amp; the closure of the Port of Baltimore. As I said to them today: we’re committed to doing everything we can to get them back to work ASAP while supporting them and their families in the meantime. https://t.co/kkRUcRAWL0Clearing debris is vital for reopening the Port of Baltimore—a huge economic hub for MD &amp; the country. I'm thankful for the Army Corps of Engineers &amp; MDOT's round-the-clock work to clear &amp; open an initial portion of the channel ASAP, as work continues to urgently clear the rest: https://t.co/fXSTuIVOyUViolence from paramilitary forces in Sudan has brought millions to the verge of catastrophic hunger. We must get more aid into Sudan to save lives — and there must be an immediate end to the violence or this horrific situation will only get worse. https://t.co/w4o8LuPjqGGlad to report @SBAgov has quickly declared that Maryland small businesses hurt by the closure of Port of Baltimore will have access to low interest rate disaster loans — one of many actions being taken by the federal government.

Thanks to @POTUS &amp; @SBAIsabel for fast action!I often say our country never gave Vietnam War vets a proper homecoming, recognizing their service &amp; sacrifice. We've learned from that mistake that you can oppose a war &amp; still honor the warrior.

On this #NationalVietnamWarVeteransDay &amp; every day, I salute our Vietnam War vets.🚨 NEWS: Today the Biden Admin announced the official launch of our Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund—the $20 billion ‘Green Bank’ we created with the Inflation Reduction Act to turbocharge green innovation.

This is a major milestone in an effort I've worked on for over a decade.🧵Importantly, we’re aiming for 70% of the $$ from this Green Bank to ensure that underserved communities are not left behind in the clean energy revolution. They have felt the brunt of the devastating impact of climate change &amp; should have a seat at the table in this fight. (5/x)It's been 15 years since I first put pen to paper on a bill to create this Green Bank, and two years since we finally got it done with the Inflation Reduction Act. With today's milestone, the Green Bank will get up and running — and the entire world will benefit. (6/6) https://t.co/YSuwbgRDSpToday I joined @ComdtUSCG, @GovWesMoore, @MayorBMScott, @RepRaskin and other leaders for an up-close look at the magnitude of the damage at the Key Bridge site.

We're working across levels of government to clear this channel ASAP so we can reopen the Port and rebuild. https://t.co/2I4ZiLGm5vToday marks one year since US journalist Evan Gershkovich was wrongfully detained by Putin's regime. His crime? Doing his job: reporting the truth.
 
That Evan was detained in the first place is outrageous — that he's still behind bars is unconscionable. Putin must #FreeEvan NOW.The lives we lost on the Key Bridge were not only hardworking men putting in long hours to make our state a better place. They were fathers, husbands, uncles. They were immigrants building their American Dream.
 
They won't be forgotten. https://t.co/yjDvd00dff#OpeningDay feels a little different this year, as Baltimore and our whole state continue to come together in the wake of a terrible tragedy. Baltimoreans are showing it every day: we are Maryland tough, and we are Baltimore strong.
 
Let’s go O’s! https://t.co/HPCYs7kbnRClearing debris from the channel ASAP is vital for reopening the port and protecting jobs and livelihoods in Baltimore &amp; MD.

I'm thankful @POTUS immediately instructed the US Army Corps of Engineers to lead this effort, which is underway, and to fully cover the significant cost.Maryland has officially declared its intent to request federal funds for repair &amp; recovery from the Key Bridge tragedy — and I'm committed to fighting for full replacement funding in every way I can in the U.S. Senate.

This is a national tragedy requiring urgent national action.There will be long &amp; challenging days ahead as we rebuild from this tragedy.

But rest assured, we WILL rebuild. As @POTUS said, we’ll move heaven &amp; earth and marshal every federal resource we need to rebuild as quickly as possible.

We’ll do this together. Maryland always does. https://t.co/HmMgfJHRKPMy heart breaks for these families, and I join all of Baltimore and Maryland in mourning their profound loss. I’m thankful for the recovery crews who will continue to work to bring these families the peace they deserve. 

A tragic day in our state. https://t.co/Gg03HAKgUGThis much is clear: the actions of first responders &amp; officials who stopped traffic from going on the bridge before it collapsed saved lives. I'm thankful for them and all who have worked tirelessly all day in search of survivors.

Their heroism is ray of light on this dark day.This morning's bridge collapse was a tragedy for Baltimore and our entire state, and a personal nightmare for the families of those who remain unaccounted for. My thoughts continue to be with those families as we process this disaster.I spoke to @POTUS earlier and I'm thankful for his full-throated support for Baltimore as we continue to address this tragedy. We will harness every federal resource necessary to build back stronger.We’re responding to the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse with all the federal, state, and local resources at our disposal.

I’m in Baltimore continuing to monitor this situation closely. All of Baltimore and all of Maryland are coming together to face this tragedy.Awful, horrific news in Baltimore this AM. I’m praying for those who were on the bridge &amp; thankful for emergency crews responding to this disaster.

I’m monitoring this situation closely and have been in touch with @MayorBMScott @BaltCoExec @SecretaryPete @NTSB &amp; state officials.Last week, the vast majority of House Rs released a plan that would harm American families — cutting Social Security &amp; Medicare and weakening the Affordable Care Act, while slashing taxes for billionaires &amp; mega corporations.

Rest assured: their plan will be DOA in the Senate.Maryland is known as “America in Miniature” because of the beautiful diversity of our landscapes and our people. Wishing all Marylanders a happy #MarylandDay! https://t.co/XZvXgTeEkIIn the six years since the #MarchForOurLives, we have repeatedly fought for common sense gun reform—and Republicans have blocked us at every turn.

Since Parkland, we've seen 260K gun-related deaths nationwide, including many in Maryland.

When will enough be enough for the GOP?Peter Angelos started as a scrappy, up from the bootstraps lawyer who fought on behalf of workers &amp; unions. Best known as owner of the O’s, I knew him as someone devoted to Baltimore who—even when he made it big—kept battling for the underdog. I’ll miss his fighting Greek spirit.The Netanyahu govt continues to arbitrarily restrict the flow of aid to 2.2 million desperate people in Gaza. 

That’s why 16 Senators &amp; I told @POTUS that declaring its recent assurances to be ""credible"" would be inconsistent w/ NEW US policy which requires facilitating aid⬇️ https://t.co/U7nUPlx8OEThe FBI's new HQ in Greenbelt is a win for its mission &amp; for Maryland. That's why I fought to secure another $200 million for the new HQ in the government funding package.

I'm determined to ensure this project is fully funded so the FBI can have the new home it deserves.It’s been 14 yrs since Pres Obama signed the Affordable Care Act — changing millions of lives. Thanks to the ACA &amp; our work to strengthen it w/the Inflation Reduction Act, more Americans have access to care than ever.

Trump &amp; Rs in DC still want to abolish it. We won’t let them.Let’s go @TerpsWBB! We’re rooting for you! #MarchMadnessToday the House voted to repeal the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund—the 'Green Bank' we passed in the IRA to spur public &amp; private innovation in clean energy while creating jobs &amp; boosting our economy.

I fought for this for 14 yrs. And you can bet I won’t let MAGA Rs stop us now.Ready for #MarchMadness, Maryland? I'll admit there were some tougher choices on the men's side this year, but the women's bracket was obvious: @TerpsWBB all the way!🐢

I have no doubt you'll make us proud, Terps. Let's go Maryland! #BuiltForIt https://t.co/aR5iVNFXNrToday the 4th Circuit began hearing a case that could upend gun laws across the US—all b/c of the absurd 2022 SCOTUS ruling saying today's gun laws have to match those from the 1800s.

I’m pleading w/ the Court: throw out this lawsuit &amp; preserve common-sense laws that save lives!Early detection &amp; improved research are vital for the global fight against lung cancer — the world’s leading cause of cancer-related deaths.

Today I wore a turquoise ribbon as part of @LungAssociation's #TurnTheHillTurquoise campaign to promote lung cancer awareness &amp; research. https://t.co/Ov9RzU52MDToday @POTUS issued important new vehicle emissions standards that will help clean up our air and accelerate our country's transition to cleaner cars and EVs⚡
 
This is good for our environment, the economy, AND public health — a win, win, win!Let's be clear: Putin killing off Alexei Navalny and locking up those who mourned his death says a lot more about the state of Putin's regime than his sham ""reelection"" over the weekend.History made: Today the Senate confirmed Nicole Berner to serve as a judge on the 4th Circuit!
 
Nicole's been a voice for the voiceless throughout her career—advocating for working people &amp; equal justice at every turn. As I said on the Senate floor, she'll make a terrific judge: https://t.co/qr7qme7pKXDecades ago, Druid Park Lake Dr. was widened against the wishes of West Baltimore residents, cutting them off from the beautiful &amp; historic Druid Hill Park.

Now, we’re working to fix that. Last week we announced $6M in federal $$ to reconnect the Park w/ surrounding communities. https://t.co/aZFIYEAaAP🚨We've now seen over a year of record-high ocean temperatures — wreaking havoc on marine life &amp; creating dangerous climate conditions around the globe.

Mother Earth is blaring the alarm on the climate crisis every single day. When will Republicans listen?https://t.co/XZGYoh4cwzThis draconian law is yet another blow for democracy and free speech in Hong Kong.

The U.S. must stand with those who fight for freedom and hold those who oppose it accountable using the tools we passed in the bipartisan Hong Kong Autonomy Act I authored with former @SenToomey.With the Inflation Reduction Act, we capped the cost of expensive Rx drugs for Medicare recipients — w/out a single GOP vote. @POTUS' new budget would expand this cap to ALL Americans.

Will Rs join us, or stand w/ Big Pharma AGAIN? Sadly, but predictably, it’s not looking good.The rise we’ve seen in Islamophobia is dangerous and unacceptable. We must redouble our efforts to stomp out anti-Muslim bigotry and all hate in its many ugly forms — it has no place in America.UNRWA is vital for distributing food+preventing starvation in Gaza. Any wrongdoing must be investigated, but we must restore funding NOW. Netanyahu's long wanted to dismantle UNRWA—doing so now would be a death sentence for thousands. I’m demanding action: https://t.co/TQAWJG5UeWToday I met with the family of Alsu Kurmasheva — a US journalist wrongfully detained by Putin on bogus, sham charges. Alsu has been away from her husband and two young daughters for almost 5 months. ENOUGH.

We need to bring more attention to her case: Putin must release her NOW. https://t.co/a4FU7XonLbOur @PeaceCorps volunteers represent the best of the spirit of America, and leave a lasting positive impact on the communities they serve worldwide.

Last week, I was glad to welcome this extraordinary group of volunteers serving in Sri Lanka—a country I have a special bond with.The state-level laws MAGA Republicans have passed targeting LGBTQ+ rights aren't just hateful — they're downright dangerous. As this report shows, school hate crimes have quadrupled in states w/ these despicable laws.

The politicians responsible should be ashamed of themselves.Let's be clear: MAGA House Republicans are strengthening Putin's hand every day they fail to pass our bipartisan bill to send vital assistance to Ukraine.

The situation is dire — Ukraine needs ammunition and other supplies NOW.

Speaker Johnson: it's time to get this done.The Netanyahu govt's claim that UNRWA is a “front” for Hamas is simply false. The inconvenient truth is that, prior to horrific Oct 7 attack on Israel, it was Netanyahu who enabled Hamas in Gaza—all b/c he wanted to block a 2-state solution. It is well documented—take a listen⬇️ https://t.co/nao2z4rP2lAs I’ve repeatedly said: anyone involved in the 10/7 attacks must be held accountable. That’s why an independent investigation is looking into such allegations against ~14 of UNRWA’s 13K workers. But we shouldn't punish 2M innocent hungry people for the actions of those ~14.Today I again met with families of hostages taken by Hamas terrorists on October 7. They shared gut-wrenching stories of their brave loved ones, including one who has a birthday today — a birthday he is spending in a cage.

It must end. Release ALL the hostages. Ceasefire NOW. https://t.co/HxcjJYiFWkOnce again, Senate Republicans had a chance to prove they actually support IVF. Once again, they failed — this time blocking @PattyMurray's bill to expand IVF care for veterans &amp; service members. Shameful.

They've made it abundantly clear: they will not protect access to IVF.Equal pay for equal work should be an obvious concept, but it's just not the reality for women in America. It doesn't just hurt them — it holds back our whole economy.

It's time to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act to close the wage gap once and for all. #EqualPayDay https://t.co/oA9LziM0IYAlong with its investments in American families and funding for many vital priorities, I'm glad to see @POTUS’ budget includes $3.5B for the new FBI HQ in Greenbelt.

I’m committed to ensuring this project is fully funded so the FBI gets the HQ it needs, right here in Maryland.While MAGA Republicans want to balloon the deficit with giveaways for billionaires &amp; tax cheats, @POTUS’ budget ensures the ultra-wealthy pay their fair share — allowing us to invest in American families while slashing the deficit by $3T.

It's a budget for the American people.The situation in Haiti is rapidly deteriorating. The US should push hard to bring a Kenyan-led peacekeeping force to Haiti as a 1st step to address this crisis, as well as expand TPS access for Haitians who have fled violence. Longterm stability requires free and fair elections.Today @POTUS released a budget that would further strengthen our economic recovery — investing in working  families while protecting Social Security &amp; Medicare, cutting the deficit &amp; ensuring the ultra-wealthy pay their fair share.

From the bottom up and the middle out..@POTUS is right: a military operation in Rafah would be catastrophic &amp; is a “red line.” That's why we wrote him this letter to say US should not send more lethal weapons till PM Netanyahu listens on Rafah, allows more humanit aid into Gaza &amp; prioritizes returning the hostages⬇️ https://t.co/tmKyzuBUtMToday marks 3 years since @POTUS signed our American Rescue Plan into law. This law helped many American families &amp; small businesses get through the worst of the pandemic &amp; laid the groundwork for our historic economic recovery. Three years later, we're still seeing the benefits. https://t.co/xeUp99ON8cThe UN’s report confirms what we suspected — that Iran was responsible for the awful death of Mahsa Amini and other crimes against humanity in their brutal crackdown on women’s rights and free speech in 2022. Iran must be held accountable. https://t.co/Yvx3zaP5KLOn #HarrietTubmanDay, we honor the legacy of a legendary Marylander who escaped slavery &amp; helped countless others reach freedom as the “conductor” of the Underground Railroad. She also served as a Union nurse &amp; spy.

Every American should know her story. #WomensHistoryMonth https://t.co/uZeZsA7VICOf course big banks are trying to block the @CFPB from cracking down on junk credit card fees — they use those fees to pad their profits &amp; line the pockets of wealthy CEOs.

I stand with @POTUS and those fighting to keep more money in the pockets of hardworking Americans.On #InternationalWomensDay, we reflect on the extraordinary work women around the world have done to break barriers &amp; fight for equality, including here at home.

As @POTUS said last night—the MAGA extremists who underestimate the power of women will be proven wrong time &amp; again. https://t.co/yWA7nKuSvKOur economy added another 275K jobs last month — with unemployment staying under 4% for over 2yrs in a row. As @POTUS said in his #SOTU address, this is what happens when we invest in ALL Americans.

And we’re not done working to cut costs, fight junk fees &amp; shrinkflation &amp; more.Historic economic growth.
Revitalized infrastructure.
Lower costs for families.
Higher real wages.
Near record-low unemployment.
The largest investment in our climate EVER.

It couldn’t be more clear: under @POTUS, the state of the Union is strong. And we're not done yet. #SOTUMillions of veterans who were exposed to toxins during their service have already been screened under the #PACTAct, and millions more became eligible just this week. This is the care our veterans deserve — and it's saving lives. #SOTUGlad to hear @POTUS’ plan to create a temporary port for aid in Gaza. But as I’ve said, we must ALSO use U.S. law — including the Humanitarian Aid Corridor Act &amp; NSM20 — to insist that the Netanyahu government allow more aid into Gaza NOW. #SOTUMilitary-style assault weapons are designed for mass killing. They are used by soldiers in war. They do NOT belong in our streets &amp; neighborhoods.

Republicans need to get on board or get out of our way so we can ban these weapons of war once and for all. #SOTUWith the Inflation Reduction Act, we’re tackling the climate crisis head-on — turbocharging our clean energy transition &amp; creating hundreds of thousands of green jobs.

We must go further in our fight against climate change, and we'll keep working w/ @POTUS to do just that. #SOTUOurs is a nation of immigrants. While we must address the serious situation at the border, it's past time Republicans join us to pass comprehensive immigration reform — including a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, protections for TPS recipients and more. #SOTUPresident Biden is right — if Speaker Johnson &amp; MAGA Republicans cared about border security, they would’ve passed the bipartisan bill put forward last month.

They know if we address it there’s nothing for them to talk about. It's politics, plain and simple. #SOTUJunk fees may seem small to wealthy CEOs, but they add up big time for ordinary Americans. We've worked w/ @POTUS to crack down on junk fees in everything from credit cards to concert tickets, retirement plans &amp; more.

We won’t stop fighting to keep more $$ in your pocket. #SOTUBillionaires shouldn't be able to dodge their taxes and leave working Americans holding the bag. We fought alongside @POTUS to ensure the IRS can go after wealthy tax cheats.

MAGA Republicans are STILL trying to repeal our law. We can't let them. #SOTUThe expanded Child Tax Credit was one of the most effective poverty-fighting tools we've ever had — cutting child poverty in half to the lowest level in history. We're working with @POTUS to bring it back. #SOTU.@POTUS is right: we can lower the deficit and invest in American families by ensuring billionaires &amp; mega-corporations pay their fair share.

If MAGA Republicans actually cared about the deficit, they'd help us get it done. (Spoiler alert: they don’t and they won't.) #SOTUThanks to our work to pass the Inflation Reduction Act, we’ve capped the cost of insulin at $35/month for Medicare recipients. And we would’ve capped insulin costs for ALL Americans, but MAGA Republicans blocked us. We won’t stop pushing to get it done. #SOTUWe’ve fought for years to empower Medicare to negotiate lower Rx drug prices. Together with @POTUS, and without a single Republican vote, we got it done — and millions of people are seeing the benefits.

We won’t stop fighting to lower Rx drug prices for ALL Americans. #SOTUWe've worked with @POTUS to revitalize our infrastructure across the board — modernizing and building new roads, bridges, airports and more in Maryland and across the country.

America is building again and America is leading again. And that's thanks to Joe Biden. #SOTUWe passed the CHIPS and Science Act to boost American leadership in developing some of the most advanced technologies in the world.

The results are in: we're bolstering our national security and creating good-paying jobs — and we're doing it here in America. #SOTUWe’ve worked with @POTUS to create an economy from the bottom up and the middle out. The results? Increased real wages, historic job growth, near record-low unemployment &amp; more.

We still have work to do to cut costs for American families, but the American economy is back. #SOTUHere’s what we know: if MAGA Republicans were in charge, they’d pass a national law banning abortion &amp; IVF — dismantling reproductive rights &amp; the ability of many to start families. We can’t let that happen.

We won't stop working w/ @POTUS to protect these rights for ALL. #SOTUEvery day that we don't send vital aid to Ukraine is a win for Putin &amp; our adversaries. Remember — this isn't just about Ukraine. It's about the fight for democracy vs. autocracy in Europe and beyond.

Mr. Speaker: Our bipartisan bill is on your desk. Let the House VOTE! #SOTUFrom overseeing record job growth to tackling junk fees, fighting the climate crisis, lowering healthcare costs, revitalizing our infrastructure &amp; more — @POTUS will have a lot to cover in tonight’s #SOTU.

I’m headed to the Capitol now for his speech. Hope you’ll tune in! https://t.co/mtbWNkmEHrGlad to see this. As I wrote w/@SenJeffMerkley &amp; others, using our sealift capability to deliver more aid is vital➡️https://t.co/6uZrkxM4es
 
But we MUST also use US law—incl. the Humanitarian Aid Corridor Act &amp; NSM20—to push the Netanyahu govt to allow more aid into Gaza NOW.For the first time ever, Americans will soon be able to purchase birth control without a prescription. This is HUGE for ensuring access to contraception — especially at a time when MAGA Republicans are attacking reproductive rights across the country.While MAGA Rs are working to let wealthy tax cheats off the hook, we're working to keep more $$ in your pocket.

I've fought for years to get rid of this kind of consumer gouging &amp; this @POTUS move could save Americans $10B per year. We won't stop in our fight against junk fees.It’s obvious PM Netanyahu &amp; extremists in his govt like Ben-Gvir &amp; Smotrich have restricted humanitarian aid to Gaza. They’ve said so. That’s why I recently took to the Senate Floor to call on the Biden Admin to use US law already on the books to get more aid to starving people⬇️ https://t.co/8aT6jqBDH1Widespread ethnic cleansing, rape &amp; other atrocities are being committed right now in Sudan — reminiscent of the awful massacres we saw 20 yrs ago.

We must do more to address this crisis: those responsible must be held accountable &amp; the violence must stop.https://t.co/J44D8ZalyxWe hate it too, Cookie Monster. And it’s not just cookies! Greedy corporations are making lots of things smaller without cutting prices. We’re working to stop them — no one should be getting richer off smaller cookies!At a time when Americans already pay too much for groceries, the Kroger-Albertsons merger would risk raising prices even higher &amp; reducing competition across the board — hurting consumers &amp; workers while helping ultra-wealthy CEOs.

Glad the FTC is working to block this merger.As we mark the upcoming anniversary of #BloodySunday, we honor the civil rights heroes who bravely marched for justice in the face of brutal attacks. 

We must honor their legacy with action, not just words — and that starts with passing the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. https://t.co/vLNJRbUfIPThe UK, Germany, France, Italy &amp; others have rightly called for an independent investigation into the killing of over 100 starving Palestinians trying to get flour from humanitarian aid trucks in Gaza 3 days ago. The U.S. must join them. We need transparency &amp; accountability.Courage and defiance in the face of brutal oppression. Putin may have silenced Alexei Navalny, but his voice lives on — carried by the millions who dream of freedom, democracy, and a better future for all. https://t.co/APDGJ5hypHBottom line: ultra-wealthy Americans shouldn't be able to dodge their taxes and leave hardworking Americans holding the bag. Glad to see the IRS working to ensure these ultra-rich tax cheats pay what they owe. https://t.co/v1AzaaJ6rMLook, we know exactly where MAGA Republicans stand when it comes to women's reproductive rights.

If it were up to them, the disastrous abortion bans and court rulings we've seen across the country would be federal laws. Make no mistake: that will not happen on our watch. https://t.co/31fAsPvScsWe owe it to our children &amp; theirs to protect our environment &amp; tackle the climate crisis head-on.

Honored to have received a perfect score on @LCVoters' #LCVScorecard — I won't stop fighting to protect the Chesapeake Bay, the air we breathe &amp; our planet for generations to come. https://t.co/QyR5bxNzKuPeople in Gaza are starving. And civilians are dying every day—including in today's horrible incident in Gaza City. ENOUGH. @POTUS must demand accountability &amp; ensure that large scale deliveries of aid can reach desperate civilians NOW. We cannot be complicit in this catastrophe: https://t.co/y8tFhwtmMEJohn Lewis reminded us every day that the right to vote is precious.

Today, we're reintroducing the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act to protect that foundational right nationwide.

Your vote is your voice — and every American deserves to be heard.Here's what we know:

If we don't provide aid for Ukraine, they will run out of ammunition.

If Speaker Johnson brings our bipartisan bill to the floor, it’ll pass w/ huge margins.

This is a vital moment for democracy &amp; America's credibility. Speaker Johnson: Let the House vote!Thanks to the PACT Act, millions of veterans have been screened for toxic exposures during their service. And starting March 5, millions more will be eligible for screening — years ahead of schedule — expanding potentially life-saving care and treatments.After the disastrous Alabama ruling, Republicans have been scrambling to voice their ""support"" for IVF and the ability of many Americans to start families.

Well, Senate Republicans just blocked @SenDuckworth's bill to codify access to IVF as the law of our land.

Shameful.We're at a historic, hinge moment in the war in Ukraine. It's not just about the future of Ukraine itself — it's also about the larger battle between democracy and autocracy around the world.

Failure is not an option. Speaker Johnson MUST bring our bipartisan bill to a vote. https://t.co/EW3Eq5nmEgWhen MAGA Rs claim to support IVF, remember they not only fought to overturn Roe &amp; passed state laws eliminating repro rights, but House R’s also intro’d a bill that could threaten IVF &amp; the ability of many to have families.

When extremists show you who they are, believe them.History has shown time and again: the more a dictator tries to silence dissenting voices, the louder those voices grow and the weaker the regime gets.

Putin locking up Oleg Orlov is the latest cowardly move by an increasingly isolated and unpopular regime.Speaker Johnson keeps saying he won't support assistance for Ukraine without border security...as if he didn't just tank a bipartisan Ukraine and border security bill. This isn't leadership — it's amateur hour.Here we are again — days away from a government shutdown because MAGA House Rs are unwilling to do one of the most fundamental parts of their job: keeping the government open.

They’re a broken record of failed leadership, but I won't stop fighting to prevent a shameful shutdown.It should not have taken so long, but glad we’ll finally be able to welcome Sweden into the NATO alliance. Putin’s brutal assault on Ukraine has now led to both Sweden &amp; Finland joining NATO — a clear strategic blow to Russia.

Now House Rs must pass vital assistance for Ukraine.Two years after Putin's invasion of Ukraine, the resolve of the Ukrainian people remains strong. And on this solemn anniversary, we stand in solidarity. Our support for Ukraine's fight to uphold democracy &amp; stand up to authoritarianism must not waver. The House must act NOW. https://t.co/Zhn2dvk6DeDespite what they may claim, Republicans know no bounds when it comes to taking away reproductive rights, including when and how to have a family. The Alabama Court’s IVF ruling needs to be overturned NOW. And I’ll keep fighting in Congress to protect doctors' &amp; patients’ rights.We cannot back down in holding Putin &amp; his cronies accountable. From the death of Alexei Navalny to their horrendous actions in Ukraine, they must pay a price. And the House GOP must quickly allow the passage of assistance to Ukraine — or be complicit in aiding &amp; abetting Putin."

My statement w/ @SenDanSullivan, @JohnJamesMI &amp; @RepRussFulcher on our bills to overturn Biden's EV mandates ⬇️ https://t.co/fTHGwvB6fEBiden’s EV mandate is unrealistic and just won’t work in states like Nebraska. Many rural communities in Nebraska are more than 45 minutes away from an EV charging station. If we are going to set a national mandate, we need to make sure it works for every state.

It also affirms that @SenSchumer's ridiculous call for new leadership in Israel should be labeled for what it is: election interference.God bless our brave law enforcement officers who are on the frontlines of Biden's open border chaos. When will enough be enough?It doesn't take an act of Congress for the President of the United States to enforce the law on our border.Joe Biden loves to pick winners and losers in our economy by punishing entrepreneurs and job creators with crippling regulation. Americans who value the free market should be outraged by Biden's costly and reckless EV mandate agenda.Today, Joe Biden's radical EPA finalized a new rule in their effort to ban gas-powered cars and force a national EV mandate. I introduced the Preserving Choice in Vehicle Purchases Act to reject this nonsense and protect consumer choice and free market competition.Good to see the Supreme Court affirm that if the Biden administration won't protect our southern border, the state of Texas has every right to do so.Last year, President Trump returned to Tulsa to cheer on the athletes competing in the @NCAAWrestling Championship.

He was a commander on the 1969 Apollo X mission, and is still recognized for the all-time highest reentry speed of any manned spacecraft.

That means if your home electric bill used to average $120, it's now costing you nearly $160 for the same usage. And Joe Biden wonders why more Americans aren't thanking him for a ""winning"" economy.When Joe Biden took office, inflation was at 1.4%.

It's not just a month for remembering our past — it's a time to recommit ourselves to the fight to defend our civil rights.The Pennsylvania Supreme Court's decision today shows exactly how powerful a federal Equal Rights Amendment could be. 

It's time to finalize the #ERANow as the 28th Amendment to our Constitution and defend the reproductive freedom of every American. https://t.co/4NtaM9YDiIOn International Holocaust Remembrance Day, we honor the six million Jews and millions of other victims killed during the Holocaust. We can never forget the horrors of the Holocaust, and we must never give up the fight to root out antisemitism, bigotry, and all forms of hate-fueled violence.

International Holocaust Remembrance Day is especially painful this year after the horrors of October 7th, when 1,200 innocent people were killed and hundreds more were taken hostage — including Holocaust survivors. In the aftermath we've seen an alarming rise in antisemitism here and around the world. Now more than ever we have an obligation to speak out against antisemitism and stand up to protect our Jewish neighbors.Never underestimate the power of American workers!

I was so proud to celebrate @UAW's historic victories with @ShawnFainUAW and our union brothers and sisters from New York and across the country. And we will keep fighting until every American worker has the fair wages and benefits they deserve!We can restore our right to reproductive freedom and enshrine women’s equality in the Constitution. Congress and 38 states have already ratified the Equal Rights Amendment. 

It’s time to finalize the #ERANow and protect our civil rights. https://t.co/4MZez03aecIt's been nearly two years since extreme, Trump-appointed Supreme Court justices overturned #RoeVWade.

But in those past two years, reproductive freedom has won every single time it was on the ballot.

The American people are ready to fight to defend their rights.18 more illegally trafficked guns are off the streets of Brooklyn.

Thanks to my provision in the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act that made gun trafficking a federal crime, we're breaking up gun trafficking rings in New York and across the country. https://t.co/N0eTHlM7e7Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. believed we could get to the Promised Land — but to get there, we all had a responsibility to fight injustice, eradicate racism, and defend our civil rights.

Today we honor his legacy and recommit ourselves to continuing his work. https://t.co/DAV1S1wR3MWhile I was in Israel this past weekend, I met with the families of Itay Chen and Omer Neutra, two New Yorkers who are still being held hostage by Hamas. Their families have been in indescribable pain these past three months, hoping their sons are alive and will be returned home. This nightmare must end now — and I will keep working until we bring Itay and Omer home.The 9/11 Health Program has helped care for thousands of survivors and first responders — but a technical glitch excluded some first responders at the Pentagon and Shanksville.

I fought to fix that in the latest defense bill. We won't break our promises to 9/11 first responders. https://t.co/Fc8a1G5E6b2023 was incredible, but I’m even more excited for the opportunities ahead of us in 2024. Wishing you all a very happy New Year! https://t.co/3rhiznjBqvThanks to the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, over 1,300 illegal guns have been taken off our streets — including 190+ AR-style weapons.

And thanks to my provision making gun trafficking a federal crime, we're breaking up gun trafficking rings across the country. https://t.co/DQPQ1qAB17I fought for nearly a decade to reform the military justice system. It took a long time to pass my reforms, but finally, victims of sexual assault and other serious crimes have the independent, impartial justice system they deserve.We passed the #PACTAct last year, and already 5 million veterans have been screened for toxic exposure.

These screenings help detect and treat potentially life-threatening conditions. And early detection and treatment can make all the difference to veterans and their loved ones. https://t.co/kDSCKESglTWishing a peaceful, joyous holiday to everyone celebrating Kwanzaa!Merry Christmas and happy holidays! https://t.co/y6FubvWstTFrom my family to yours, we wish you all a very merry Christmas with your loved ones! https://t.co/QZSIkL1jcGIn 2022, the number of union elections skyrocketed.

In 2023, historic union strikes made workers' voices heard.

And in the last year, nearly a million union workers won an immediate pay hike of 10% or more.

When unions win, working families win. https://t.co/CBH1jykonMBecause every time reproductive freedom is on the ballot, freedom wins.

Florida: https://t.co/6I9KsSy58ONext year, New Yorkers have the chance to codify our right to reproductive freedom in our state constitution. We all need to turn out to vote and pass our state's own Equal Rights Amendment.From the beginning, this case was a politically motivated attack on our right to make our own medical decisions — and it could have massive consequences.

If this works, they'll attack access to birth control next.

These decisions belong with doctors and medical professionals.I introduced my bill to make gun trafficking a federal crime in honor of Nyasia Pryear-Yard, who was just 17 when she was shot and killed. Nyasia's mother and I worked together for over a decade to pass that bill, the core of which eventually became part of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act and was signed into law last year. And it's already helped get over 1,300 illegal guns off our streets — including at least 50 guns seized in Nyasia's home borough of Brooklyn. 

The fight against gun violence may be difficult, but it is not hopeless. And we can honor the memory of Nyasia and all the other victims of gun violence when we hold gun traffickers accountable, get these illegal guns off our streets, and help prevent more tragic, senseless deaths in the future.When Republicans promise that they don't support a total abortion ban, just remember that Texas Republicans did everything they could to stop a woman from getting lifesaving care, even when her fetus had a terminal condition.Before 2022, Ardith Lindsey would never have had her day in court. But thanks to the bill @GretchenCarlson and I passed to ban forced arbitration in cases of workplace sexual harassment, she's able to share her story and fight for the justice she deserves. https://t.co/FOy28XlwdZThank you everyone for your lovely birthday wishes!

This year especially, Hanukkah holds a special significance as a story of the Jewish people's resilience, strength and perseverance. It is a story that shows us that nothing is beyond repair and that even the tiniest light can vanquish the darkness. It tells us that if we stand together, there is nothing we cannot overcome. From my family to yours, I wish everyone celebrating Chag Sameach!Jonathan and I had a blast with @KamalaHarris! Happy holidays, everybody! https://t.co/0xzJ6gDvolYesterday I spoke at a special session at the @UN and called on them to condemn the sexual violence committed by Hamas against Israelis during the October 7th attack. Their silence sends the chilling message that we do not value the humanity of women and girls in Israel — and all around the world — who are the victims of these horrific crimes.I fought for over a decade to make gun trafficking a federal crime.

Now, one year after the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act was signed into law, 1,300+ illegal guns have been taken off our streets and 200+ have been charged with gun trafficking. https://t.co/5owcSF7nE3Despite graduating near the top of her law school class, Sandra Day O'Connor was only offered a job as a secretary when she applied for a job at a major law firm. But she refused to back down. She pursued her legal career until she shattered that highest glass ceiling by becoming the first woman to serve on the Supreme Court. She paved the way for women like myself to pursue our own legal careers — and brought women's voices and perspectives to the highest court in our nation. And while I may not agree with every decision she ever made, I respected her dedication, her attention to the practical effects of the Court's work, and above all, her respect for precedent, particularly her vote in Planned Parenthood v. Casey. My heart goes out to her family and loved ones today.I can't think of a single other issue where you'll find such overwhelming, bipartisan support.

Americans are demanding that we pass #PaidLeave!My Spotify Wrapped knows me so well 🍁 https://t.co/KJHJ6lTqnBThank you @dieworkwear for sharing Bilma's story and revealing the working conditions of thousands of garment workers in the US.

I introduced the FABRIC Act because garment workers deserve fair pay, safe working conditions, and a strong labor movement to fight for those rights.I'm incredibly relieved to hear that Abigail Mor Edan has been released. She was the youngest American being held hostage by Hamas — she just turned four on Friday.  

When I first met with her family a month ago, they told me the gut-wrenching story of how Abigail's parents were murdered before she was taken hostage. I know how worried they were for her safety, and I can't even imagine how relieved they must be to have her home. We must keep working until every innocent child being held hostage by Hamas is returned home to their families.Shop small, shop local, and support the small businesses that support our communities. Happy #SmallBusinessSaturday! https://t.co/OZntUb5MgpI've just heard the incredible news that Danielle Aloni and her five-year-old daughter, Amelia, have been released by Hamas.

I’ve been working closely with Danielle’s cousin Alana, who lives in New York, who told me the harrowing story of how Danielle and Amelia were taken hostage while visiting with Danielle’s sister, Sharon, her brother-in-law David, and their three-year-old twins, Emma and Julie. 

Sharon, David, Emma, and Julie are still being held hostage. 

My heart is with Danielle, Amelia, Alana, and their entire family as they begin to heal from this ordeal. I’m praying for the safe return of Sharon, David, Emma, and Julie. And I'm thinking of all the families still waiting for their loved ones to be released. I won't stop working until we bring all the hostages home.Wishing you all a very happy Thanksgiving! https://t.co/KivaNmSGCwThe turkey is just about done!

Please follow guidance from local officials. I’m deeply grateful to all of our brave first responders responding to this situation.Had a fantastic time catching up with Mayor Kamal Johnson and checking in on his priorities for Hudson, NY! https://t.co/N0uNJjRASeI recently spoke with one older worker who was let go just before he would have been entitled to get significant retirement benefits. The timing was suspicious — but because of a forced arbitration clause, he couldn't get justice.

That's why I introduced a bill to ban forced arbitration clauses in cases of aging discrimination. I just passed a law banning forced arbitration in cases of sexual harassment and assault, so I know this is a fight we can win. https://t.co/UtINdKMMG4We had a fantastic time showing you around!Happy birthday, @JoeBiden! https://t.co/7rwK7XIsgCEstoy agradecida de recibir el respaldo de @rubendiazjr, un apasionado e inquebrantable defensor del Bronx.

Veterans were willing to give everything in service to their country — and I'll never stop fighting to make sure they have the care and respect they deserve. https://t.co/C2knwDgs5OAnd all of this happened after just ONE daycare closed. Now imagine this story happening over and over again, all across the country.

Our economy relies on families having affordable, reliable child care. Congress needs to restore the funding that kept these daycares open.I always have an incredible time at #SOMOS, and this year was no exception.

Our bill would require the State Department to actively report on this emerging threat and the impact it has on the current drug epidemic in America.I support IVF. It is protected under law, and it will remain that way.

No one is taking IVF away — but Senate Democrats know that their radical stances on abortion are far outside of the mainstream, which is why they are resorting to scaremongering regarding the availability of IVF.
 
IVF has been a blessing for countless families and it’s not going anywhere.I am deeply concerned about the recent report released by the Commission on the State of U.S. Olympics and Paralympics, which was supposed to look at the overall effectiveness of the Olympic structure.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, this commission — which was a Democrat-led effort as several Republican-appointed commissioners were unable to participate — called for more government to address imaginary problems.

To improve the Olympic structure, the Commission recommended creating new government sports offices, higher taxes, and more federal regulators — as well as regulating Little League.

In the report, the word ‘baseball’ appears 17 times, while ‘diversity, equity, and inclusion’ appears 170 times.

If the goal is to have fewer kids participating in sports — and fewer parents volunteering to help — I can think of no more effective idea than having youth leagues micromanaged by virtue-signaling bureaucrats.Biden’s latest ban on gas-powered vehicles and replacement with electric vehicles is another direct assault on consumer choice and the American way of life.

This is a brazen violation of the intent of the law.

This is what we’ve come to in America.

We can no longer tolerate a system that allows billionaires like Jeff Bezos to gain $23 billion in wealth this year alone when working people across this country can’t afford to feed themselves. Period.Enough is enough. President Biden must make it clear to Israel that if humanitarian aid access in Gaza is not immediately opened up, he will stop military assistance to Israel. https://t.co/jnqSsibmGFA majority of Americans now believe that — due to the horrific humanitarian disaster in Gaza — the U.S. should block new arms shipments to Israel.

The case has to do with mifepristone, a medication that doctors prescribe to induce an abortion. It’s how most abortions happen. It’s saved the lives of countless women facing pregnancy-related health complications.

The FDA first approved Mifepristone 24 years ago after a rigorous four-year process of scientific trials and analysis. The medicine has been used safely and effectively by countless women for more than two decades. 

Then, last April, a one time anti-abortion activist who became a Trump-appointed federal judge cast aside decades of precedent and issued a ruling imposing a nationwide ban on Mifepristone, declaring that the FDA had improperly approved the drug almost a quarter century ago. 

It’s not right that one unelected lower court judge with no scientific or medical background can be dictating health care policy for the entire nation.

This case is about way more than one drug. If this ban is allowed to stand, any judge anywhere in America can unilaterally decide to ban any medication of any kind they want.59 years ago today thousands of brave Americans began a long march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama. It was the activists’ second attempt; a few weeks earlier, the marchers, led by the late John Lewis, were met at the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma by a blockade of state troopers who attacked them with billy clubs and tear gas when they refused to disperse. 

On March 21, 1965, the marchers set out again. They would walk for five days before reaching the state capitol. 

For all of those who might be feeling discouraged, I hope that the words of Martin Luther King Jr. fortify your spirit.6 years after this historic moment, I am so impressed by all that the young people who participated in March For Our Lives have accomplished so far, and continue to achieve.

We are also home to the highest maternal mortality rates among high-income nations, and the risk is even greater for incarcerated pregnant women. That's why Lauren Underwood, Alma Adams, Ayanna Pressley, and I are championing a bill to end the inhumane practice of shackling pregnant people in prison. It's time for federal action to protect lives and uphold people’s dignity.In March of 2020, COVID-19 was killing thousands of people a day across the world with no end in sight.

Among the most vulnerable were U.S. prisoners. Lawmakers from both parties recognized that people in prison with no history of violence, who had medical vulnerabilities, or who committed nonviolent offenses could be safely removed from prisons and put on home confinement to lower the risk of COVID spreading.

Congress went to work and passed the CARES Act unanimously in the Senate and with all but a handful of votes in the House, and it was immediately signed into law by President Trump. 

Home Confinement has not only proved to be enormously successful in keeping people out of prison, but has proven to save taxpayers a tremendous amount of money.

This program has allowed people to begin the process of reintegrating into society. They have jobs, go to school, and take care of their families. 

Now, some Republican Senators want to end this successful program and return people who have successfully returned to their communities to prison. This makes no sense. Sending thousands of people who are successfully complying with home confinement requirements back to prison is morally wrong and fiscally irresponsible.

https://t.co/sAUcy0FxsTI remain against the death penalty in our nation. It is flawed, biased and unjust and on many occasions innocent people have been given a death sentence.  

This particular execution is a flagrant example of cruel and unusual punishment. It is not the carrying out of justice but the ushering in of more injustice. 

Again, from Bryan Stevenson:

""Proximity has taught me some basic and humbling truths, including this vital lesson: Each of us is more than the worst thing we’ve ever done. My work with the poor and the incarcerated has persuaded me that the opposite of poverty is not wealth; the opposite of poverty is justice. Finally, I’ve come to believe that the true measure of our commitment to justice, the character of our society, our commitment to the rule of law, fairness, and equality cannot be measured by how we treat the rich, the powerful, the privileged, and the respected among us. The true measure of our character is how we treat the poor, the disfavored, the accused, the incarcerated, and the condemned.""One of my favorite questions to ask young people is ‘if you were the leader of America, and you could make ANY change you want, what would the change be?’ The answers from students from Far Brook School in New Jersey who visited me last year did not disappoint. In fact, they left me with a profound sense of hope. I know that future generations are striving to be the best stewards of this nation.A year from today, you don’t want to wish you’d done more. I hope you’ll join me in working every day to ensure that next year on January 20th, we’ll be celebrating the inauguration of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, with a Democratic House and Senate.In 2021 the IRS reported that wealthy tax cheats failed to pay $688 BILLION dollars. This is money that could have made a difference in everything from closing our deficit, to funding public schools. 
After this report, in 2022 the Biden Administration passed the Inflation Reduction Act that expanded funding to the IRS. In hopes that the incredibly under-resourced function of government could recoup the cheated money...and its working. To this date, the IRS has recouped $520 million. But truthfully this is still only a drop in the bucket. And now that better funding the IRS has proven to work, Republicans are doing everything in their power to stop this progress. Going as far as proposing a $20 billion budget cut to the IRS. 
It doesn’t take a budget expert to know that allowing the wealthiest taxpayers to get away with cheating actually increases the burden on hardworking American families who play by the rules and pay their fair share.Three years ago, I was part of a group of lawmakers who pushed for and won a historic, one-year expansion of the Child Tax Credit. President Biden signed our plan into law….and it was the largest middle class tax cut of my generation.

It put up to $300 per child per month straight in the pockets of families with kids, which could be used to cover the cost of gas, groceries, childcare, and more. 

It worked so well, it cut the child poverty rate in half. 

But because Congress failed to act, it expired at the end of 2021. The tax cut we fought for went away, and the child poverty rate doubled.

But the Democrats, led by Senator Ron Wyden, stood our ground and demanded concessions in exchange for tax cuts Republicans wanted, and this week a deal was struck and an expanded child tax credit is on the verge of coming back, in effect for the next 3 years. 
While this isn’t everything that was in place before, what we know for sure is that it will have a huge impact for families with kids and for millions of Americans, and that is progress worth fighting for.Another government shutdown?  Let’s talk about it. 

A fundamental role of Congress is to keep the government functioning and funded. But the way this is supposed to be done hasn’t  happened since 1997! What we’ve all seen recently is the government coming to the brink of shutting down again and again, and Congress needing to pass last-ditch stopgap spending laws that temporarily keep the government open for a period of a few weeks or months. 

The consequences of government shutdowns are disastrous. Even the threat of one is bad for our country. They cost taxpayers billions of dollars and threaten vital services. 

The truth is, we can avoid this mess. There is no need to punish hardworking Americans by allowing a shutdown to happen.Today the Senate Judiciary Committee reflected on the recent five year anniversary of the First Step Act, a landmark law that began to right the past wrongs of our criminal justice system which waste taxpayer dollars and human potential and don't make our communities safer. We heard stories of individuals whose lives were directly impacted and improved by the common sense changes in the law. I’m so proud of the work we did to get this across the finish line 5 years ago and remain resolute in advancing the next steps needed to make justice system truly just.One of the ideas Dr. King elevated that inspires and motivates me most is that of the beloved community: an idea that a peaceful and prosperous future is not a utopian vision, but possible through policies to end poverty and discrimination, conflict resolution through non-violent means, and loving one another, friend and foe, seeing our common humanity.

I know that this goal is lofty, and right now it might feel we are so distant from reaching it, but I know that it is possible and achievable. If you believe this like I do, then we must come together and work together every single day to make it so.

Gabby survived, recovered, and to this day is one of our great leaders for gun safety in the United States. 

Gun violence is the number one cause of death for children in this country. No other county has our level of gun violence and death. We are one of the most powerful nations in the world…yet we continue to fail in protecting our children from such a senseless and preventable threat. 

May Gabby’s story and her tireless work inspire us, and remind us that we should NEVER give up in the effort to defend our nation from one of our greatest threats to life - gun violence.

When you love this country, you fight for the people who make it work. https://t.co/pcyQQNAbiwRamadan Mubarak to everyone observing in Ohio and around the world.

Wishing you a holy month filled with prayer and reflection.Colon cancer is on the rise &amp; disproportionately impacting Black &amp; brown Americans.

That's why we expanded access to screenings and passed our bipartisan law to protect people on Medicare from surprise medical bills for their colonoscopies. #ColorectalCancerAwarenessMonthNEW — thanks to our legislation, Cleveland is eliminating medical debt for hundreds of thousands of Ohioans. You shouldn't have to go into financial ruin just for getting sick or injured.

We’ll keep working to cut the cost of health care so fewer Americans face this burden. https://t.co/DQR4P4E5EdAccording to investigators, Norfolk Southern’s controlled toxic burn made an already bad situation much worse.

https://t.co/HsNEPZj7F8Happy #InternationalWomensDay. Today I'm celebrating Toledo residents Jodi Gross &amp; Elaine Page, who won the Canary Award at our Ohio Women’s Leadership Summit last year for their outstanding commitments to serving their community.

Jodi &amp; Elaine make me proud to be an Ohioan. https://t.co/K2Nop1KM3cOhio’s Urban League chapters are the embodiment of what it means to serve others. They play a critical role in our state and connect Ohioans with job trainings, work opportunities, civic engagement, and so much more.

It was an honor to meet with their leaders this week. https://t.co/GQczD1zzlmWe’re bringing more manufacturing jobs back to Ohio, including in Akron, where we’re leading the charge to develop the sustainable polymer technologies of the future.

Honored to have him here with me at the State of the Union tonight. https://t.co/QwUMyTXaEOSheriff Wasylyshyn and I agree — we must do everything we can to stop fentanyl from entering our country.

Too many Ohioans have lost someone from this deadly drug. We're at the State of the Union together tonight to push for more action.

I’ll always stand up for our firefighters &amp; help give them the tools they need to keep our communities safe. https://t.co/ckd3QeJOJYThis is outrageous. The people of East Palestine are still living with the consequences of this toxic burn.

This is more proof that Norfolk Southern put profits over safety &amp; cannot be trusted.

Sheriff Wasylyshyn is on the frontlines of the fentanyl crisis in Ohio. He's seen up close how urgent it is for us to come together, fight fentanyl, &amp; keep Ohio communities safe. https://t.co/81NusXz1nUPoliticians should not be able to take away a lifeline that grants millions of Americans the joys of parenthood.

I’m proud to support the Senate bill to protect IVF &amp; other fertility treatments, and get politicians out of Ohioans’ personal health care decisions.The administration needs to act fast to close a trade loophole that’s letting millions of uninspected packages into our country each day. It’s dangerous, and it’s being abused by foreign companies and drug traffickers. https://t.co/I5Xra54Ni0Akron will lead the country in sustainable polymer innovation &amp; manufacturing.

Proud to lead this bipartisan effort to ensure Akron continues its long tradition as the Rubber Capital of the World.

Beijing knows Biden is weak. 

The United States MUST stand with Taiwan.Democrats want you to believe the border is “secure.”
 
The American people know the truth.
 
We need to CLOSE the border.The Biden administration is considering removing the Houthis’ terrorist designation — for the SECOND time.

This is unconscionable. We must show strength to terrorists, not appeasement.The Tennessee National Guard unveiled a Women’s History Wall in Nashville’s Joint Force Headquarters. It is wonderful to see so many brave women honored for their service. May their legacy live on!

Woke leaders in CA are bolstering the CCP’s ability to spread communist propaganda in our own backyard.Prayers for our friends in Taiwan 🇺🇸🇹🇼Instead of securing the border, proposing fiscally responsible solutions, and empowering law enforcement to keep our communities safe, Biden has prioritized appeasing his radical base.
 
@POTUS —put America first.The American people are tired of two tiers of justice in this country.Saddened to hear of Coffee County Mayor Matheny’s passing. 

Thankful for his service to our state and praying for his loved ones during this difficult time.God bless Texas for doing what Joe Biden won't.According to reports, nearly 1,000 gotaways crossed the border on Easter Sunday alone. 

Close the border. Secure our country.RT @TennesseeEMA: Severe weather is expected for the entire state today. The highest risk of severe weather, including possible tornadoes a…When is Biden going to prioritize Americans’ safety and close the border?Amid Biden’s reckless spending, I’ve introduced legislation to cut federal spending by 1%, 2% and 5%.
 
It’s time to restore fiscal responsibility.RT if you want President Biden to build the wall and SECURE the border.As the result of woke judges &amp; DAs’ soft-on-crime policies like cashless bail, violent crime has increased.

Criminals belong behind bars — not out on the streets.President Biden wants to extract a $5 trillion tax increase per his FY25 budget.
 
This includes a:
— $37 billion tax on American energy
— $24 billion retirement tax
— Corporate tax higher than Communist China

 The American dream is much more difficult under Biden.On this holiest of days, let us pray for Israel and the Jewish people as they fight to eliminate Hamas terrorists.A hard fought ending to a great season.

Tennesseans cannot afford another four years of Biden’s reckless spending.Build the wall.
Stop catch-and-release.
Deport criminal illegals.
Enforce the rule of law.

Rather than bolstering national security, Biden has undermined it.The violence happening at the southern border is unfathomable. 
 
Enough is enough.
 
How long will @POTUS let this go on?I’ve seen what Texas is doing to secure our border for the American people. 

Meanwhile, the Biden administration is fighting tooth and nail to keep our border wide open.

@AdamShawNY

https://t.co/O7l8kkuzQhRanchers and private citizens in Texas are afraid for their safety because of Biden’s border crisis.

This should never be the case. Biden must secure the border. https://t.co/u2t5hZ6HyHDid you know — among the 40 monuments, memorials, statues &amp; historic sites on the National Mall, there is not one dedicated to an American woman?

Read my op-ed with @SenHydeSmith, @SenLummis &amp; @SenKatieBritt in @PostOpinions for Women’s History Month ⬇️

https://t.co/r7mTgPmA8DUnder Joe Biden’s open border, we’ve had:

— Over 9.2 million illegal border crossings
— Over 300 terrorist apprehensions
— At least 85,000 missing migrant children
— An 850% increase in fentanyl seizures compared to 2019I spoke to National Border Patrol Council President Brandon Judd in Eagle Pass today.

His message is clear — Biden is to blame for this crisis. https://t.co/txoFHMb30oGod bless Texas and the work they are doing to secure our border. https://t.co/YxMBqIAGPUIn Eagle Pass, TX, I heard from ranchers who have had their homes invaded by illegals aliens and seen horrific acts by smugglers &amp; coyotes.

This is inexcusable and preventable — secure the border. https://t.co/g0BpQR9n5CToday marks one year since the shooting that occurred at the Covenant School in Nashville.

Violence against children is one of the most heinous crimes imaginable — especially in schools where they should be safe to learn, play, and be children.My heart breaks for the families of those who lost loved ones in this senseless act of violence, and my prayers are with them on this solemn day.In Congress, @SenatorHagerty and I introduced the SAFE School Act that would allow public &amp; private schools to train and hire veterans and former law enforcement officers to serve as school safety officers &amp; provide funding to harden schools and increase physical security.At the border, I heard how cartels and smugglers are utilizing TikTok to recruit children. 

We must deal with TikTok. It is a threat to our national security..@BPUnion, @TxDPS, and law enforcement are working day &amp; night do what the Biden administration won’t — secure the border.

I am grateful for their continued efforts to keep our nation safe. https://t.co/iQSHQyDY10President Joe Biden is suing states like Texas to open up the southern border, while President Trump secured the border.RT @NEWSMAX: ""It is imperative that we secure the border.

@FaulknerFocus https://t.co/ODit40QbgRThe Biden administration is fighting tooth and nail to prevent Texas from securing the border.
 
That’s because Biden’s border policy is an open border.
 
@Varneyco https://t.co/I2rAF6yv8zUnder Joe Biden, every town is a border town. 

Joe Biden created this crisis, and he must fix it.

@TxDPS @BPUnion https://t.co/Zdmmd9vPfi9.2 million illegal border crossings and counting.
 
All under the Biden administration.I’m on the ground in Eagle Pass, TX.  
 
Tune in to @Varneyco on @FoxBusiness now to hear me discuss how Texas is stepping up amid Biden’s border disaster. https://t.co/oTIQ8rBdiII’m touring the southern border with law enforcement and the message is clear — the Biden administration created this crisis and if they wanted to, they could fix it. https://t.co/xg9BN426e1Texas is stepping up and taking the necessary measures to stop illegals from coming onto U.S. soil.

My CONTAINER Act supports the implementation of these barriers which are greatly needed as Biden has allowed over 9.2 million illegals into our nation. https://t.co/nqJfg3MQIdBorder states like Texas are stepping up to do what Joe Biden won’t — secure our border.
 
I’m in Eagle Pass with @TxDPS to receive an update on the impact of Biden’s failed border policies and to see firsthand how they are working to keep Americans safe.From terminating the Remain in Mexico policy, to reinstating catch-and-release and flying over 320,000 migrants into our communities, Biden has created this crisis at every turn.Over 9.2 million illegals have attempted to cross our southern border since Joe Biden took office — that is unacceptable.
 
Tomorrow, I will go to Eagle Pass, TX to help shine a light on what the @TxDPS, @BPUnion &amp; law enforcement are doing day and night to secure our border.March Madness showcases college athletes’ grit and hard work. 

Unfortunately, these same athletes can become the targets of never ending, unfounded investigations.

We need to pass my NCAA Accountability Act to establish guardrails on NCAA investigations.Joe Biden greenlit the secret flight program that transported over 320,000 migrants into our communities.

He wants these illegals in our nation.

That’s why he won’t secure the border.Deport criminal illegal aliens. 

They are criminals. 

Everyone should agree with this.Wishing all who celebrate a blessed Palm Sunday.“It is the Lord who goes before you. He will be with you; he will not leave you or forsake you. Do not fear or be dismayed.” — Deuteronomy 31:8That’s because Democrats want an open border.

If they actually cared about Americans’ safety, they would have voted in favor of my CLEAR Act to deport criminal illegal aliens.

Instead, they voted against it.Migrant encounters reached nearly 190K, setting a new record for the month of February.

This is an invasion.RT @elonmusk: Also insane!Instagram is now trying to suppress political content just months before the next presidential election.

Why is Meta attempting to censor the democratic process?Last night, Senate Democrats voted AGAINST my measure — the CLEAR Act — to deport criminal illegal aliens.

They are blatantly disregarding Americans’ safety. https://t.co/azRk31melrPleased to see Tennessee is the first in the nation to protect songwriters’ voice &amp; likeness from AI abuses.

This will eliminate consumers choices and price out buyers in the market. This is a gross example of government overreach.This situation is not going to get better without swift action from the Biden administration.

This would never have happened on President Trump’s watch.

@POTUS — close the border now.The U.S. submitted a UN resolution calling for an immediate and sustained ceasefire in Gaza, applying pressure on Israel to reach a deal to pause fighting.

Senate Democrats are using fear tactics to falsely paint Republicans as anti-IVF to scare American families.

SafeSport, the organization tasked with protecting elite athletes, must do more to ensure these sick individuals never come within 100 yards of our boys &amp; girls. https://t.co/THFc6WunRvSince day one, Biden has used his power to open our southern border. 

Heinous crimes have followed, including the rape of a disabled teen in Massachusetts. DHS has confirmed the illegal alien charged entered our country under Biden’s parole program. 

Enough is enough.Horrific.

We must secure the southern border NOW.A new national security law passed in Hong Kong has put human rights &amp; freedom in grave jeopardy.

We must continue to fight back against the CCP’s efforts to erode democracy.Every town is a border town.

That is the opinion of thousands of Tennesseans on last night’s telephone town hall. https://t.co/y9SW9XCsE9Starting on day one, Joe Biden gave 94 executive orders over his first 100 days in office to weaken the border and immigration law.

Senator @MarshaBlackburn and I led our colleague….@SecBlinken said he will travel to the Middle East this week to push a ceasefire deal.  

We cannot give in to terrorists.Memphis is no stranger to rising crime as woke judges allow criminals back onto our streets.

https://t.co/1S60CsIVkgSoft-on-crime policies that are being pushed by woke protesters &amp; judges are fueling rising crime.
